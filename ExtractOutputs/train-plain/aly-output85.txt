Easy 1-Pot Black Bean Soup


In college I subsisted on cafe lunches to power me through writing papers and studying for tests. Panera was a frequent stop of mine since they had salads and soups and SO much coffee. One of my go-to’s was their black bean soup and I’ve had it in the back of my mind to recreate it ever since.
Let me show you how easy this 1-pot, 30-minute version is!

This recipe starts by sautéing onion and garlic until fragrant, then adding canned black beans, vegetable broth, and plenty of salt, pepper, and spices.
The last-minute addition of dark chocolate totally made this soup! It provides depth of flavor, balances the heat, and ties all of the spices together. Swoon!


We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s:
Easy to make
Versatile
Hearty
Wholesome
& SO satisfying
This would make the perfect meal when you need something hearty and delicious on the table fast! It’s tasty on its own but also pairs well with cooked grains, tortilla chips, avocado, onion, and salsa!
