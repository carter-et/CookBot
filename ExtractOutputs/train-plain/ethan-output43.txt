                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

This vegan soup recipe is surprisingly easy to make. The flavorful broth is spiked with garlic, tomatoes and a hint of coriander. Just slice and dice your cabbage and fennel and you'll be enjoying this quick healthy soup in no time. Source: EatingWell.com, January 2020
