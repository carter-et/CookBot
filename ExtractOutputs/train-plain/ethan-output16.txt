                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

Poblano peppers add a touch of heat to these vegetarian quesadillas, but a sweet bell pepper is tasty, too, if you want something milder. Start these quesadillas in the oven and finish them off in a skillet for melty cheese and crispy tortillas. Source: EatingWell Magazine, March 2020

                                                3 tablespoons corn oil, divided
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon tablespoon chili-lime seasoning or rub, such as Tajín (see Tip)
                                            








                                                2 cups chopped cauliflower
                                            








                                                1 cup chopped poblano peppers
                                            








                                                8 (6 inch) corn or whole-wheat tortillas, warmed
                                            








                                                ½ cup reduced-sodium refried black beans
                                            








                                                ¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
                                            








                                                  Salsa for serving
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1

                                      Step 2
                                    



Whisk 1 tablespoon oil and seasoning in a medium bowl. Add cauliflower and poblanos; toss to coat. Spread evenly on the prepared pan. Broil on the upper rack until just tender, about 8 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees .







                                      Step 3
                                    



Top half of each tortilla with 1 tablespoon each beans and cheese and 1/4 cup of the vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Fold the tortillas in half.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 4 quesadillas and cook, flipping once halfway, until browned, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 4 quesadillas. Serve the quesadillas with salsa, if desired.







          Tips
                            



Tip: Chile-lime seasoning originated in Mexico, where you'll find it on the rims of margarita glasses and sprinkled on mango and jicama slices. It's recently become popular in the U.S. We use it to add spice and tang to the quesadilla filling in this recipe.
