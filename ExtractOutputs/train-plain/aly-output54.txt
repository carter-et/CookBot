Easy Gluten-Free Lasagna (Dairy-Free!)


If given the choice of one final meal, there’s a good chance we’d choose lasagna. No really, we seriously love lasagna (exhibits A, B, C, D, E, and F)! 
Lasagna is just one of those meals that’s the perfect balance of comforting, filling, and delicious, and it can feed a lot of people with minimal effort. 
This version is our dairy-free and gluten-free take on classic-style lasagna (we have a vegan version if that’s more your thing). And it’s about as simple as it gets, requiring just 10 ingredients to prepare. Let’s do this!



How to Make Lasagna
Making lasagna is pretty straightforward in terms of assembly. But the ingredients can be swapped out for just about any dietary preference. Start by preparing your three layers:
Sauce (ground beef or lentils + marinara + seasonings)Noodles (we chose Capello’s gluten-free & grain-free for this version)Cheese (homemade dairy-free macadamia nut or storebought)
Our sauce is prepared by sautéing garlic, red pepper flake (optional), ground beef, and salt until the meat is browned. Then add in your favorite marinara sauce and season further with optional Italian herbs and sweetener.
Next, the noodles are boiled and drained. Or — our preference — opt for no-boil gluten-free lasagna noodles such as Capello’s.
The homemade “cheese” comes next. Simply add macadamia nuts (or slivered almonds or soaked cashews) to a food processor along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and sea salt. Blend it up, slowly adding water until it resembles ricotta cheese! Or, sub store-bought (our favorite being Kite Hill Ricotta).
Finally, let’s layer!

How to Layer Lasagna
We like to use a little jingle to remember the order: Sauce, Noodles, Cheese. (Repeat x2). 
And then on the fourth repetition: Sauce, Noodles, SAUCE!
Once you make lasagna enough times, you won’t even have to look up the order!
Then at the very end, add a sprinkle of homemade vegan parmesan cheese for even more flavor.

How Long to Bake Lasagna
To allow the flavors to develop, we like to bake the lasagna until it’s nice and bubbly with crisp edges. 
Baking uncovered on the middle rack at 350 degrees F (176 C) for 40-45 minutes is perfect.

We hope you LOVE this lasagna! It’s:FillingHeartyFlavorfulEasy& So delicious!
This lasagna is perfect for make-ahead meals, feeding a crowd, or any time you’re craving a simple, filling dinner. It’s delicious on its own, but also pairs well with salads or other greens.

Instructions



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Set out a large baking dish (9×13 inch or similar size) and lightly grease.


Begin by preparing sauce. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, garlic, red pepper flake (optional), beef, and salt and begin sautéing, stirring occasionally for about 8 minutes, or until meat is browned. Use spoon to break meat into small pieces.


In the meantime, if using noodles that require boiling, bring a large pot of water to a boil (if using no-boil noodles, skip this step). Once boiling, add a healthy pinch of salt and your lasagna noodles (or other pasta shape). Cook according to package instructions to achieve an al dente texture — tender with a little bite. Then drain and set aside. Optional: Drizzle pasta with a little oil to prevent sticking.


To the pot, add your marinara sauce and stir to combine. Cook on low for about 10 minutes to marry the flavors. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding salt to taste or red pepper flake for heat. You could also add dried Italian spices and/or sweetener of choice to balance the flavors at this time (optional). Turn off heat and set aside.


Next, make your "cheese." Add macadamia nuts (or sub soaked cashews) to a food processor or a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and sea salt and mix/blend into a loose paste.


Add lesser amount of water (2/3 cup or 120 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Continue mixing, scraping down sides as needed. Then add more water — 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time — until a thick paste forms. I find I get the best texture results with a food processor, but a blender can work, too. It just generally requires more scraping and more liquid. For texture, you’re looking for a spreadable soft “cheese.”


Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for saltiness, lemon juice for acidity/brightness, or garlic powder for garlic flavor. Blend again to combine.


To begin assembly, add a thin layer of marinara sauce to your baking dish. Spread to ensure even distribution. Then add a layer of the cooked pasta noodles (or uncooked noodles if using no-boil). Top with a thin layer (roughly 1/3 of the mixture) of your nut cheese and spread into an even layer.


Add another thin layer of marinara sauce and use a spoon to spread over the cheese layer to coat. Then add another layer of noodles. Top with another 1/3 of the cheese and spread into an even layer.


Add another layer of marinara sauce and spread into an even layer. Then top with another layer of noodles and remaining 1/3 of the cheese, and spread into an even layer. Top with another layer of marinara sauce and spread into an even layer.


Top with another layer of noodles and, finally, remaining sauce. Optional: Top with a sprinkle of vegan parmesan cheese.


Cook on the middle rack of your preheated oven for 40-45 minutes uncovered, or until the sauce is bubbly and/or the edges are browned.


Carefully remove from the oven and let cool 5-10 minutes before serving. Then slice, serve, and enjoy. We recommend garnishing with additional vegan parmesan cheese and fresh chopped basil or parsley. See notes for freezing instructions.*

This was AWESOME. I’ll be honest though…I was skeptical about the macadamia nut cheese and cashew cheese at first, tasting it straight out of the food processor. But once everything was assembled and out of the oven, well, I probably should’ve made more! It was so good! The tempeh + mushroom blend was excellent, and I made my own marinara (similar to the one on the website but I started with a yellow onion, garlic, and a few carrots before adding the canned tomatoes and basil at the end). I will be making this again for sure!

This looks amazing! Do you mind talking a bit more about why you chose macadamia nut for the cheese? I’m debating on splurging on the macadamia nuts and wondering if it’s a game changer and worth it. Thank you so much!

First time making lasagna. Turned out very very good!! I used soaked cashews instead of macadamia nuts. I did adjust the flavor of the cashew cheese a bit by adding more nooch, garlic powder, and salt. Otherwise, I followed to recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly!

This was so good! Very satisfying. I was craving lasagna for a while and then this popped up! I used slivered almonds instead of macadamia nuts. I wish I could have found the capellos noodles but maybe next time, will definitely be making this again. Thank you Dana, I’ve been loving your content lately!

Hi Dana,
Thank you for all of your FREE content created over the years which has to have cost you tons of money and time. Particularly when you are not sponsored and don’t work with companies. We should all be bowing down and kissing your little finger and little toe. Honestly!
As for the whinging vegans  – so  entitled,  privileged and ungrateful. Snowflakes.  I think that you are really awesome and I have been following your blog since 2010. 
Once again, thank you for all of the great recipes. Ignore the harassment and online bullying and I hope that you get better soon.
I’m going to try this recipe with turkey schitznels. Xoxo

Dairy-free communicates its free of dairy, not necessarily eggs or meat. But yes, we are releasing a new website design soon with dietary symbols to help you clearly distinguish which recipes best suit your dietary preferences.

Yet another delicious recipe! I loved the macadamia nut ricotta spread, I had almond ricotta left over and used them both on different layers.  I also used bison instead of beef and I had been buying Bello sauce already and had it in my pantry, easy button :)    I want to thank you for giving meat options in your recipes, it’s a great option especially when you are having company over!

Hi Aline, I’ve shared many times that I decided to incorporate eggs and meat back into my diet (and the blog) purely for health reasons. I’m sharing an article about the transition soon. It was never for money. We don’t do sponsored content, we don’t work with companies, and we don’t receive free products, which is are policies we’ve had in place for years now.

I made this last night and it was so yummy! The recipe is missing the sweetener but I added it in at the end when cooking the sauce (just a note for Dana). The cheese was delicious! My husband, who’s always skeptical of my dairy-free recipes that are traditionally dairy-full, loved it!

Hi Jo! We made the transition to including egg and meat recipes to the blog in spring 2019. But if you’d prefer to see only vegan recipes, you can always find those minimalistbaker.com/vegan. And you can update your email subscription to exclude meat recipes by selecting the “vegan only” preference at the bottom of any email we sent you recently.

I was trying to cobble together a dairy-free lasagna recipe to make this weekend from other places on the internet but this showed up in the nick of time! This is exactly what I needed, can’t wait to try it! 
Will sub cashew or almonds as there are no macadamia nuts available here and maybe sub sautéed veg for the ground beef as I live somewhere where beef is expensive.
If subbing almonds, can I use raw almonds with the skin still on?

Is there a way you can find to tag recipes that contain meat, so that we know they contain meat before entering?  I can’t tell by the title on this one.  Even if an alternative is offered, i.e., lentils, perhaps they can be set apart as two different recipes?
For some of us, pictures of raw meat kill the appetite.  It’s a physical reaction that some can’t help, so we have relied on safe vegan places where we don’t have to cross paths with such pictures.  Your diet and recipes are totally up to you, of course, and I enjoy integrated food blogs all the time, as long as I can avoid the sections I don’t want to see.  Since you have had a heavily vegan following (we’ve been readers and purchasers for years), it’s likely there are others who would appreciate the heads up so we don’t have to see the pictures if we don’t want to.  Thanks.
Since you most likely have many customers who came to you when this was a vegan blog, it’s reasonable to assume there are others that might also feel this way.  Simply making it very clear which is which could allow those of us who are your long time readers to avoid something that might affect us, while still allowing you to post what you wish.
