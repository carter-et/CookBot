Easy Massaged Kale Salad (15 Minutes!)



If you’ve ever wondered why some people suggest massaging kale before eating it, you’ve come to the right place. 
We’re here to share the how and why of massaging kale, plus our go-to kale salad for hosting. Let’s do this!



This 15-minute, 6-ingredient salad starts with the kale — our favorite variety being curly. Here’s why:
Best Kale for Massaged Kale Salad
Because some kale varieties are more delicate than others, we suggest using curly kale for massaging because it’s quite hearty, fibrous, and benefits from a good massage.
Lacinato kale (also known as dinosaur or Tuscan kale) can be a bit too tender and delicate in our experience, making it not as ideal for massaging. 
That being said, lacinato can still be massaged, we just prefer curly!

We love using this quick and simple method for removing the greens from the stem: Simply grab the bottom, stalky end of the stem and run your other hand upward along the stem using a tight hold to remove the greens.
When you do this, the greens break off, usually taking the top 1/2 or 2/3 of the stem with it. That’s okay! We actually love the texture the stem provides, just not the bulkier, larger portion of the stem as it can be quite fibrous and difficult to chew. (The discarded stem can either be composted or used to make DIY vegetable broth.)
Next, give your kale a chop and add it to a mixing or serving bowl.

Why Massage Kale?
The reason it’s often recommended to massage kale is simple: Kale is quite tough and fibrous and can be difficult to chew compared to other greens like romaine lettuce or spinach. 
By massaging it for as little as 2-3 minutes with a little oil and/or lemon juice, it becomes more tender, making it easier to chew and digest.
The other reason is to infuse the kale with more flavor before the dressing is added. 

How to Massage Kale
Our go-to method: Add chopped kale to a large bowl and top with lemon juice and olive oil. Use clean hands to massage for about 3 minutes to soften the leaves and infuse the leaves with the oil and lemon. A pinch of salt added near the end of massaging adds even more flavor.
You’ll notice in the photo below that by the end of massaging the kale gets quite glossy and is slightly reduced in volume. That’s exactly what you’re going for.

Best Dressing for Kale Salad
In all of our testing, we haven’t found a better dressing for kale than tahini! It’s a match made in salad heaven. See our favorites here:

Easy Massaged Kale Salad (15 Minutes!)

Everything you need to know about massaged kale salads, plus a delicious, fast, and easy recipe for our go-to kale salad with tahini dressing! 15 minutes, 6 ingredients required.

					Side Dish				


Cuisine:

					Grain-Free, Vegan				


Freezer Friendly

					No				


Does it keep?

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


2
large bundles
curly kale*, large stems removed and roughly chopped


1
Tbsp
lemon juice


1
Tbsp
extra virgin olive oil 
(if avoiding oil, omit)


1
healthy pinch
sea salt




DRESSING


1/3
cup
tahini 
(see our Tahini Review!)


3
Tbsp
lemon juice


1-2
Tbsp
maple syrup 
(or sub agave, or honey if not vegan)


1
pinch
sea salt 
(optional)


Water to thin 
(~3-6 Tbsp or 45-90 ml as original recipe is written)




TOPPINGS optional


Crispy Baked Chickpeas
(or store-bought)





Instructions



Once you’ve rinsed and dried your kale, run your hand along the stem to remove the green leaves from the stalky stem. You don’t have to remove the stem completely (we actually enjoy the top 2/3 in the salad), but be sure to compost or reserve the larger bottom stalks for DIY vegetable broth.


Stack your stalks of kale on top of each other and finely chop. No need to mince, just cut into manageable, bite-size pieces.


Add kale to a large mixing / serving bowl and top with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Then massage with clean hands for about 3 minutes. The point of massaging is to infuse the kale with the lemon juice and oil, and also to break down some of the tough, fibrous characteristics of kale. This makes it easier to chew and digest, and makes for a more tender salad. Season with salt, massage/toss once more, then set aside.


Next prepare the dressing by adding tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, and salt (optional) to a medium mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Then slowly add water until creamy and pourable. The mixture may seize up and thicken at first, but continue adding water a little at a time, whisking until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, or salt to taste. Set aside. (Store leftover dressing in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days — sometimes longer.)


To serve, top with desired amount of dressing and crispy chickpeas (optional), toss, and serve. Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days (not freezer friendly). We enjoy leftovers chilled, but also find that they sauté nicely (even with the dressing and chickpeas) if you’re looking for a cooked version.






 

Notes
*We recommend using curly kale for massaged kale salads as the non-curly (a.k.a. lacinato / dinosaur / Tuscan variety) is more tender to begin with and doesn’t require as much massaging. It does work, we just prefer curly for this recipe.
*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with the lesser amount of maple syrup and without optional ingredients.
*Prep time does not include baking optional crispy chickpeas.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I never had any idea what “massaging” make meant until I saw that photo of your hands actually doing it. I used to hate kale, but now I love it – now that I actually know how to prepare it. Five stars!

Great recipe.
Better dressing for kale? = Equal parts balsamic, pennut butter, dark soy sauce and maple syrup.

What about using baby kale?

That would be delicious! But it usually doesn’t need massaging since it is more tender.

This looks wonderful!  I was wondering if this would work using the bagged (already cut up) bags of Kale (from Trader Joes) unable to get to my Whole Foods to get it bundled… I’m wondering about the stems, I don’t want to cut the stems from every cut up piece in the bag!  Do you have experience using the bagged kale?  What would you suggest?  I plan to take this to a party tomorrow and will report back of the success :)
Thanks in advance for your response
