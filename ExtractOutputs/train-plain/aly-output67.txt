Creamy Vegan Broccoli Salad (Mayo-Free!)



When considering what recipes to share this holiday season, I couldn’t shake the idea of a plant-based take on classic broccoli salad.
Have you ever tried it? It’s basically a salad with raw or blanched broccoli, bacon, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and onion tossed in a sweet mayo-based dressing. While indulgent, it satisfies that salty-sweet flavor I’m often looking for in salads.
So I got to work on an easy plant-based version and am super pleased with the results. Let us show you how easy it is to make!



This recipe is simple to make, requiring just 20 minutes and 10 ingredients.
It starts with chopped raw broccoli, which gets topped with salted roasted sunflower seeds, red onion (or shallot), dried cranberries (or currants), and coconut bacon!

Next comes the dressing: A creamy, cashew-based sauce made with cashew butter, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, and salt!
It’s reminiscent of the mayo dressing typically used in the classic version of this dish, but even better in our opinion. Plus, it’s oil-free, naturally-sweetened, and comes together in minutes!

All that’s left to do is toss! The dressing coats the salad beautifully. It can be served immediately or stored in the refrigerator to marinate up to 2-3 days before serving.

We hope you LOVE this salad! It’s:
CrunchySalty-sweetQuick & easy FlavorfulFiber-rich& Seriously delicious
This would make the perfect side this holiday season and beyond! It pairs especially well with sandwiches (like our Vegan BLT Sandwich or Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich) and our Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf.”

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
SALAD


3/4
cup
coconut bacon


7
cups
chopped broccoli 
(~2 small heads broccoli as recipe is written)


1/2
cup
roasted salted sunflower seeds 
(or sub other salted nut of choice)


1/2
cup
finely diced red onion or shallot


1/4
cup
dried cranberries or currants 
(unsweetened // or sub chopped pitted dates)




DRESSING


7
Tbsp

apple cider vinegar


1/2
tsp
sea salt 
(plus more to taste)


1
pinch
black pepper 
(plus more to taste)


3-4
Tbsp
water





Instructions



If you haven’t made your coconut bacon yet, do so now (see instructions) and let cool.


To a large mixing bowl, add coconut bacon, chopped broccoli, sunflower seeds, onion or shallot, and dried fruit of choice.


To a separate small mixing bowl, add cashew butter, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, sea salt, and pepper and stir/whisk to combine. Then add water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time and stir/whisk until a pourable, creamy sauce is achieved. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness, vinegar for tanginess / acidity, or salt to taste.


Add the sauce to the broccoli salad and toss to combine. Enjoy immediately or transfer to the refrigerator to chill and allow the flavors to marinate. Leftovers will keep up to 4-5 days in the refrigerator, though best within the first 2-3 days. Not freezer friendly.

Sorry I didn’t rate the recipe before – I’m not used to commenting on recipes!  But this one turned out so well that I had to share what I thought of the dish.  This is definitely a keeper!

Perfection!  I enjoy this waaaaay more than the mayo version (and that was just from tasting it without letting the flavors marinate).  Made my own cashew butter because I couldn’t find it at the store and it turned out great.

This was unbelievably delicious and even better than the traditional mayo-based broccoli salad yet still captured all the flavors!  I wasn’t entirely convinced when I tasted the dressing on its own, but once mixed with all the other components, it was perfection.  And the coconut bacon totally blew my mind – it seriously tastes like bacon.  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds, including the carnivores!  Only thing I did differently was to steam the florets for three minutes and then shock and drain well.  So good, can’t wait to eat it again.

I liked this a lot.  And wow, how have I not discovered coconut bacon before now?!  I accidentally just put it all together instead of making the dressing separate – oops!  Will try it again.
I used pickled onions instead of raw.  Do raw onions usually soften some if you leave this to marinate awhile? I just didn’t find there to be enough moisture, and I detest raw onions!
Thank you for another great recipe!

I’m wondering if this would work with lightly steamed broccoli instead of just plain raw broccoli?  If so, do you think it would hold for a day in the refrigerator?
Thanks for all your amazing work!  You are my go-to for any new recipe or food idea.  May your 2020 be the best year yet!

I made this to the tee except substituted with almond butter as what was in frig and Loved it!
Also only had regular size Trader Joe’s organic coconut flakes, which is a little bigger than most flakes and pretty substantial. Blended in beautifully and look forward to using this “bacon” in Mac and Cheeze ! ?

Hello,
I saw awhile back that you had an online food photography course for purchase and I’m wondering if its still available to purchase? I believe it was for iphone users to learn how to post more effectively on instagram and I’d love to purchase and learn if its still available. couldn’t find it in the archives of the blog so wanted to be in touch directly.
Thanks!

I just made this and it is delicious. I did not have cashew butter so I put raw cashews in my Bullet with a touch of olive oil. I subbed pumpkin seeds for the sunflower seeds. I loved the sweet and tangy flavor of the dressing and the crunch from the seeds and the coconut bacon. This is a great dish to take to a potluck.

Merry Christmas to me!  I haven’t had much time to make dishes from scratch lately, but had the time today and made this for our Christmas Eve dinner.  It is delicious!  I made it as written (used raisins for the dried fruit) and I believe it is going to be a  hit tonight.
Decades ago I worked for an organization who served the traditional version of this–packed with mayo and bacon and I always went “ham” on it.  (This is long before I considered eating a plant-based diet.)  :) Thanks for bringing back good memories and for introducing me to a healthier dish.
Merry Christmas Dana and team!

Fabulous recipe!!! i used unsweetened salted sunflower seed butter instead of cashew butter because of the difference in price point and it ended up being a wonderful substitution!!! probably a bit nuttier than it would have been with cashew butter.  fun and flavorful vegan holiday dish- cant wait to share it with the omnivores in my family!

Have you tried making this with almond butter instead of cashew butter? I wonder how that would affect the flavor profile….?

It would definitely affect the flavor, but perhaps in a good way! Let us know if you give it a try!

I tried it for a party and it was a big hit – even with those who normally make the salad with mayo.  I steamed the broccoli for 3 minutes, immediately ran it under cold water to stop the cooking, then put the dish together as stated above.  I made it one day ahead, and it was still crunchy and delicious!  I waited to add the coconut bacon until right before I served it.  I also had roasted pecans that I used instead of seeds.  I really don’t like the dryness and texture of raw broccoli, and with this method and this dish, I could eat it every day!
Thanks for the great recipe, and thanks for the encouragement to try my tweak.  It worked better than I could have imagined!
