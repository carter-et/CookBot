Easy Bibimbap with Gochujang Sauce



Any time I eat bibimbap it takes me back to the first time we visited South Korea in 2013. It was our first trip abroad and we visited friends who showed us around and taught us the way of bibimbap, which means “mixed rice” in Korean.
Let me show you my inspired take with this Easy Bibimbap with Gochujang Sauce—perfect for weeknight meals, hosting, and beyond!


What is Bibimbap?
Bibimbap is a traditional Korean dish comprised of rice, a mixture of vegetables, an egg, and sometimes meat, often served in a hot stone bowl. It’s typically served with sauce, my favorite being Gochujang.
What is Gochujang?
Gochujang is a spicy-sweet Korean sauce that’s typically made of a blend of chilies, glutinous rice, salt, and fermented soybeans. Because most brands are not gluten-free I made my own vegan Gochujang recipe and have to say it’s quite close to the real thing! Plus, it only requires 1 blender, 5 ingredients, and 5 minutes to prepare.

My take on bibimbap requires just 10 ingredients to make and comes together quite quickly, especially if you’ve already cooked your brown rice and made (or purchased) your Gochujang sauce.
What vegetables are in Bibimbap?
Aside from cooked rice, bibimbap typically comes with a variety of cooked vegetables with various preparations. But to keep things simple for a weeknight meal, I simply sautéed bean sprouts, green onion, carrots, zucchini, and fresh spinach in a little sesame oil and coconut aminos (or sub tamari or sea salt), and topped with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.


Do you need a dolsot (hot stone bowl) for serving Bibimbap?
Traditionally, bibimbap is served in a hot stone bowl called a dolsot, which allows you to assemble the bibimbap and then heat the underside so the rice gets browned and crispy. Yum.
However, you can either skip the dolsot and use a basic serving bowl or my little hack is to stir fry your cooked rice in a little sesame oil until crispy and brown before serving so it gets some added crunch and texture.
Is Bibimbap vegetarian?
Depending on the ingredients in the Gochujang sauce and whether or not it’s served with meat, bibimbap can be vegetarian when served with an egg. We opted for a perfect fried egg, but also suggest some vegan options below that are just as delicious.


We hope you LOVE this inspired take on bibimbap! It’s:
Quick & easy to makeColorfulCustomizableComforting& Delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal or for hosting, as it’s customizable with protein and vegetable topping options. The Gochujang sauce isn’t overly spicy either, so it’s even great for guests with more sensitive palates.
Need ideas for what to serve this with? How about some Homemade Vegan Kimchi, Gochujang Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts, or Gochujang-Spiced Cauliflower Wings?!

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
RICE


3/4
cup
short-grain brown or white rice, rinsed
(soaking for 12-24 hours to speed cooking is optional*)


1 ½
cups
water 
(if rice was soaked, reduce water by about 1/4 cup (60 ml) as recipe is written)


1
pinch
sea salt




VEGGIES + EGG


2-3
Tbsp
sesame oil, DIVIDED
(toasted for more flavor, untoasted works, too*)


3
cups
packed mixed vegetables 
(such as finely shredded carrot, thinly sliced zucchini, or spinach)


1
heaping cup
bean sprouts 
(if you can’t find, sub more mixed vegetables)


2
stalks
green onion, sliced on an angle


2
cloves
garlic, minced


2
Tbsp
coconut aminos, DIVIDED
(or sub tamari to taste, or sea salt)


2
large
eggs* 
(we recommend organic, pasture-raised, and as ethically sourced as possible, such as Vital Farms)




FOR SERVING


2-4
Tbsp
Korean Gochujang Sauce 
(or sub store-bought — look for vegan or gluten-free as needed, such as Wholly Gochujang)


Kimchi
(optional)


Toasted or raw sesame seeds
(optional)





Instructions



Optional: If soaking rice, rinse, drain, and add to a mixing bowl and cover with cool water. Soak for 12 hours or overnight. For a quicker soak, cover in hot water for 1 hour. Then rinse and drain.


To a medium saucepan, add cooking water (if you soaked your rice, start with 1 ¼  cups water as recipe is written), rinsed rice, and salt. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender and fluffy. Soaked rice generally takes less time to cook. Unsoaked rice can take up to 30 minutes or more. Keep covered and set aside.


In the meantime, prepare Gochujang sauce. Skip if using store-bought.


While the rice finishes cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat (stainless steel or cast iron are best). Once hot, add 1 tsp of sesame oil or enough to just coat the pan.


Once the oil is hot, add vegetables one type at a time and cook in batches until lightly browned (1-2 minutes), seasoning each with a little minced garlic and a dash of coconut aminos, tamari, or sea salt. Cooking in batches allows you to arrange vegetables separately over the rice for visual effect. We cooked the zucchini first, then carrots, green onion, bean sprouts, and spinach. Add more oil to the pan as needed between vegetables.


Arrange cooked vegetables in individual piles on a serving plate and cover gently to keep warm until serving.


To cook eggs (if vegan, see notes for options!), heat the same pan over medium heat. Once hot, add a little more oil (sesame or otherwise), and carefully crack eggs. For sunny-side up (our preference), cover briefly with a lid to steam for 1 minute, then remove lid and continue cooking until whites are cooked but yolks are still runny. Turn off heat and set aside (uncovered).


To serve, divide desired amount of rice between serving bowls (see notes for traditional dolsot recommendations and crispy rice hacks!) and top with portions of cooked veggies and egg.


Serve with 1-2 Tbsp Gochujang, kimchi (optional), and a dash of sesame seeds (optional). Bibimbap means “mixed rice,” so once your egg and Gochujang sauce are added, use a spoon or your chopsticks to stir everything together and mix the flavors. Then enjoy!


This dish is best fresh, but leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator up to 2 days and be reheated on the stovetop over medium heat as a stir fry. Not freezer-friendly.






 

Notes
*Soaking rice not included in prep time.*Sesame oil can be found at Asian markets and most grocery stores and is fairly affordable. Its flavor really works best in this recipe and either toasted or untoasted can be used. But it can be subbed with avocado or refined coconut oil for a similar result (don’t use virgin coconut oil or the dish will taste like coconut).*If vegan, omit the egg and sub our Crispy Baked Peanut Tofu, Quick Scrambled Tofu (similar to the tofu in this recipe), or just double up on veggies!*To keep this bowl grain-free, omit grains and double up on veggies or sub cauliflower rice!*In this recipe we served the bibimbap in bowls, but you can purchase Korean-style dolsot bowls, which allow you to cook the bibimbap after plating to get the rice crispy on the bottom of the bowl. However, for a similar effect, simply stir fry rice in a little sesame oil in a hot pan for a few minutes, tossing occasionally, until toasty and golden brown.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with equal amounts of carrot, zucchini, and spinach for the mixed vegetables, with lesser amounts of sesame oil and Gochujang sauce, and without optional ingredients.*Recipe method adapted from the amazing Maangchi, and inspired by our many bowls of bibimbap while visiting South Korea!

Served this for a korean chef at an upscale resturant I work at. Something he did unique I really like and encourage others to try was shiitake mushrooms in sesame oil and a little bit of quinoa mixed with the rice!

This was soooo good! I used wild rice (made the day before) instead of brown and added spinach, zucchini, mushrooms, and sunflower sprouts in mine.
The best part: it was super fast to make and the clean up was easy.

This was so tasty! I used all the veggies suggested in the recipe, but I subbed tamari for coconut aminos as it’s what I had on hand. I ended up opting for a store bought gochujang sauce to save time, and it was good still! A lot spicier than I expected actually, I think i’d stick to maybe 1/2-1tbsp instead of 1-2.
I’m reheating some for my lunch tomorrow (and we only have a microwave at work) so fingers crossed it stays somewhat delicious without the fresh out of the fry-pan texture.

I was end of summer lazy and cooked all the veggies together (I added red cabbage and mushrooms to your suggestions) and bought vegan gochujang sauce with tofu on mine (vegan) and steak and egg on my husband’s (Not vegan) and we were both happy. Thanks for another great recipe. About to have your apple crisp for dessert!

I was so nervous to make this because of how much Korean chili goes in the sauce! I wasn’t able to find Korean chili anywhere so I ended up using mostly chili powder and some cayenne and closer to 1/4 cup because I was nervous. This recipe is so tasty!! Thank you minimalist baker for inspiring me to leave my comfort zone, I don’t think I’ve ever eaten something labeled as “Korean food” and I’m so glad I made this. Yum!

Hey Dana! Long time reader and first time commenter. I love your blog so much! I probably get over half of my recipes from here. I’ve been a vegetarian for eighteen years and last year I went full vegan. However, my husband and I recently found out we are expecting our first child and the pregnancy has required me to reincorporate eggs and some dairy into my diet. This recipe could not have come at a better time! Can’t wait to make it tonight. Thanks again for the great recipes! ?

I am so excited to make this! I was plant based for some time and used your blog and cookbook as amazing inspiration. At the beginning of this year I began eating fish and eggs again for health reasons and personal choices and I am really jazzed to see recipes on your blog that includes these! I still used your blog before I was vegan, when I was vegan, and now as a pescatarian. Your recipes are always amazing and I have passed your blog on to all of my friends (most of my friends are non-vegans and they still love the recipes)! I think regardless of what you’re eating everyone can appreciate your 1. creativity 2. understanding of what makes food good & accessible to make 3. the plethora of plant based and gluten free recipes you have already shared with the community! You’re great and I have always been a huge fan : )

Hi Dana! 
I’m a longtime reader (and frequent recipe-maker), and I just wanted to offer some more words of encouragement. I’m glad that many have voiced their support for MB, but I’ve been disappointed by the vicious comments from the peanut gallery. From my point of view, you’ve never purported to be wholly vegan, and it seems quite childish that many readers are taking your dietary choices as a personal affront. I’m glad that you’re listening to what your body needs. 
Your recipes are a wonderful boon to anyone trying to incorporate more plant-based meals into their diet, and Minimalist Baker will remain the first resource I turn to when I want to try something new, delicious, and healthful. Keep doing what you’re doing!

Hi,
This isn’t really about the recipe (though it looks amazing!), I just wanted to show my support for your blog! You have an amazing food blog and I love seeing the creations that pop up in my inbox. 
What I love about your blog is that it does focus on simple and healthy food and doesn’t subscribe to any one belief. I consider myself “flexitarian” (haha, it sounds a bit silly when I write it down) as I eat simple, healthy food, mostly plant based but if occasions come up where animal products are on offer I will eat it that too. 
I think you should keep doing exactly what you’re doing and I hope you know you’re doing an amazing job! 
Thanks for all of your hard work and amazing recipes! :-)

Reading the other comments made me chime in because you have helped us IMMENSELY coming from a heavy meat background. We are almost totally veg now and my son LOVES your dishes- the spicier the better! So thank you for all your do, it has really helped our household and will continue to.

Hi Dana,
I am a follow of your recipes, and admittedly was upset about the transition of this site to contain animal products. Your website and cookbook have been very helpful in my own journey as a home cook. I know this doesn’t have to do with this recipe specifically, but as someone who has been operating in and advocating for “plant based” eating for so long, why have you decided to change course? I understand that you don’t want to reveal some personal health issues, but considering your impact on the food community, a more detailed explanation would be helpful. Also can you explain what “ethically Sourced” means with regards to supporting the egg industry?
Thanks

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

Hi there, thanks for the question. I want to clarify a few things: Minimalist Baker started first and foremost as a simple food blog, with recipes that included meat, eggs, dairy, and gluten. Then, early on I removed dairy from my diet for digestive relief, so the recipes became dairy-free. Then, I started adding gluten-free recipes as some of my friends were sensitive to gluten, and I later became sensitive myself. Then, later I became interested in plant-based recipes, primarily for health reasons, and so the recipes took a turn in that direction. 
I never shared that I was a vegan, although I did eat primarily vegan off and on for a few years and enjoyed experimenting with recipes in this realm. However, ultimately, I felt my body was asking for more nourishment and at the recommendation of several physicians, I recently decided to add animal products back into my diet. 
The recipes have never been strictly one specific diet or another, but have rather been a loose reflection of what I’m interested in / going through diet- and health-wise at the moment, which is naturally always in flux. I have to trust that the creativity that comes from what I’m interested in or going through at the moment will in some way help or inspire our audience in some way. And I also acknowledge that this audience may grow and change and be in flux itself over the years, just as I am. I know for some it was surprising to see we’d be adding eggs and meat back in, but as we see it, it’s just another season of sharing what food excites and nourishes me right now. 
I don’t care to go into any more of my personal health history on the internet. I hope you understanding that in doing so, it opens me up to a lot of scrutiny, opinions, and medical advice that aren’t helpful because no one really knows my health situation besides me and my doctors. 
As for ethically-sourced eggs, I understand that some vegans believe there is no such thing as an ethically-sourced egg, so let’s just start with acknowledging that. But for me personally, I think ethically-sourced eggs are organic, pasture-raised, non-GMO, and free-range, which is about the best you can do unless you get eggs from your own chickens or a neighbor’s chickens. I buy eggs primarily from Vital Farms.
I hope that sheds some light and clarity on this transition.

One of my favorite recipes in months. My husband was getting a little sick of MB’s enchiladas (which are also all amazing). I left off the egg on mine, no tofu substitution necessary!
Not to add too much to comments not related to this recipe, but I am excited about this transition. I’ve been eating vegetarian and more recently vegan for most of my life, and it’s often been difficult to find recipes traditional meat eaters will enjoy. Having so many wonderful plant-based recipes intermixed with some recipes that include egg and meat makes the blog as a whole more accessible to people who may otherwise be afraid to try out a “vegan blog.” Thank you for continuing to (freely) share such inspired creations! I will continue to buy the cookbooks and recommend you to all eaters looking for a great food blog.

I love  Bibimbap and this looks like a really good recipe. The tofu is a great substitute . So, everyone has opinions about this site now. I get that. Vegans have opinions. Omni’s have  opinions etc. etc. As a vegan I’m disappointed but you know what? I adapt recipes from other non-vegan sites so I can do that here also if I choose.  It’s dangerous to start labeling people as mean or ignorant or a traitor based on personal choices such as this. (Looking at bot “sides” here). So maybe we can all express a polite opinion if we have one and feel that we must, stop throwing stones and make our own decisions about following the site or making the recipes.

I have seen these Vegan attacks on numerous websites whether they are Paleo, Vegetarian or mainstream sites. I am open to reading any recipe site and just adjust to fit my lifestyle.  I never feel personally offended by the author for making personal dietary choices and wonder if these people realize that they sound like nasty trolls.

I cannot believe you have abandoned your vegan recipes to include meat and eggs.  As you well know, vegan recipes can be adjusted by those who feel the need to include these heinous products, not vise versa.  What a SAD day for the animals who are needlessly made to suffer horribly  – and what a SAD ethical failure on your part, I cannot unsubscribe fast enough.

Peanut tofu on top of this bibambap instead of the egg is such a great substitute! I love air-frying tempeh and tofu as well. And to be totally honest, I think kimchi is COMPLETELY necessary. It adds the best tanginess and zing of flavor to the dish! LOL!

This recipe is awesome! I whipped it up tonight, and it was a huge hit. I didn’t have a ton of spinach on hand, so I added extra zucchini and carrot. Yum! It comes together pretty fast once you get started. Definitely prep everything beforehand. 
Protip to all the vegans: the egg is OPTIONAL! ;)

Dana, thanks for all the lovely recipes!
Wanted to also give support and say thanks for making it so easy to make any of your recipes vegan or vegetarian. You are clearly still supporting others having a fully plant based diet!
If we are honest, the reason the meat industry has turned to mass producing and related unethical practices is due to so many Americans (and certain other countries) demanding way more meat than is needed or healthy. Adding a moderate amount of meat to an also veggie filled diet is a sustainable practice. I am hoping those meat-eaters who are looking for healthier ways to cook will find your site. We each have to find what’s best for ourselves and I commend you for listening to your body. May peace be with you.

Hi Dana! I have been an avid follower of your blog for about 3 years now, when I first went fully vegan. Your blog inspired me to try new and delicious plant-based meals, and I will forever be grateful for that. If I ever needed a new dish or a “how-to,” I would instantly come to your blog. With the recent changes being made to the site, sadly I will not be checking in as often, but you can be sure I’ll always go back to my favorite vegan recipes from you. I am sorry that you are dealing with health concerns, and I wish you and your family well!

Also, so sorry you have had to deal with so much unessassary, irrelevant and manipulative negative feedback about incorporating animal products. Just wanted to say that the way you have communicated the change (and dealt with the haters) has been wonderfully thoughtful and transparent and if anything has made this vegan even more devoted to your blog. xx

I am super bummer that you will now be including eggs and meat in your recipes. This always felt like such a safe place to find amazing vegan recipes and share with others. I know you never claimed to be vegan, or even fully plant based, but I do have to say I am disappointed that you are now showing more support to these industries (whether local farms or factory it does not exclude the violence involved to get these products from animals nor the environmental impact), and ignoring that suffering by choosing to now include more and more animal products is disheartening. 
I’m sad to say it doesn’t feel good coming here anymore and that is, as I said, a real bummer as I had been a fan for many years.

I am very sad about this too.  It seems like so many people are giving up on veganism and that reality is very disheartening.  I feel sad too that Dana was sick and probably vulnerable and somehow became convinced that dead animals and eggs could help her.  I hope she gets better and becomes an awesome warrior for veganism once again by showing people how great the vegan lifestyle is.  You don’t need animal products, Dana!  No one does.  They only hurt us and the animals and the planet. :(

Funny how people can’t figure out how to adapt a recipe for their own needs??  Simply omit the egg or meat….not hard to do.

This is excellent–your version of gochujang is such a revelation. I started making the sauce when you first posted it; I love gochujang and to find a recipe that is not only simple but this wildly delicious and digestible, was a real gift. It’s great, too, with roasted vegetables. I’ve never commented on this blog before, but I’ve been visiting here for years and have used countless of your wonderful recipes. FOR FREE, I might add. I’ve printed out so many of them that I suspect they amount to a full cookbook. Thank you–utterly. Your inventiveness, and delight in food and people, shines through. I’m sorry that you’ve been treated poorly simply because of your decision to align your blog with your life. Many of the commenters who have turned away have missed an opportunity to exercise the compassion that is at the heart of being vegan (and eating in general, I would think), and the chance to learn flexibility. They’ve forgotten, too, that they have enjoyed your recipes while you have asked nothing of them. Thank you, Dana. I’ll be back, many, many times and look forward to your recipes.

I imagine that there are challenging moments for you during MB’s shift in direction. To share a positive note, as someone who values a plant-based diet without restricting myself and the people I cook for to non plant-based foods, I am very much looking forward to seeing a greater variety of options in your delicious recipes. Thanks for what you do.
On a separate note, I’ve been more conscious lately of the quantity of rice I consume due to the presence of arsenic. Is this something you have given any thought to?

Oh dear, I didn’t realize that the recipes weren’t vegan any more and have been recommending the website to friends. I must have missed a post or something. It’s disappointing for sure, as animal-based recipe websites are a dime a dozen, and it’s nice to not have to wade through those sites looking for “special” recipes or “here’s a picture of bacon, but vegans can substitute tofu!” BUT I have appreciated the recipes over the years, and even though I’m not going to be following you or buying your cookbooks any more, I sincerely hope that this pays off for you in the end (money-wise and health-wise).

I feel sad.
Firstly, I’m sad that a plant-based diet wasn’t able to support you in your health and that you’ve had to make the difficult decision to reincorporate animal products back into your diet. I wish you all the best and hope that this change is able to provide the healing that you are looking for.
Secondly, I feel sad about the message this portrays to the world; that a plant-based diet is insufficient to maintain good health and that someone with such influence as yourself is choosing to promote animal products despite the harm to the environment, animals, and overall health.
Thirdly, I feel sad because you are the reason that I made the change towards a plant-based diet. I found your blog a couple of years ago and have introduced all of my family and many friends to it, many of whom have also made the switch to plant-based eating. I love your recipes, your photography and your overall message of promoting health and well-being through food. I’m sad that I no longer feel the same joy that I used to because it no longer feels personal to me. I feel like I’ve lost a role model and a friend. I realise it sounds dramatic, but it was not an easy change for me to make, and you were instrumental in it. Now this just feels like any other food blog.
Finally, I’m sad about a lot of the negative and even cruel responses you’ve received. I know that the plant-based and vegan communities are very passionate about what we believe, but that’s never an excuse to treat people poorly. I hope you can understand that most vegans are compassionate people and don’t support cruelty, emotional or otherwise.

Hana, thanks for sharing your feedback and for the kind and understanding words of support. Introducing non-vegan recipes was a very thoughtfully considered and difficult decision, but we ultimately felt this was the best way to be transparent with our audience regarding my changing diet.
Some people have been unkind in response to this transition, but we have also received a lot of support.

I thought you were completely vegan?  why on earth would you have an egg in a recipe?  I mean, I get that some people have their own hens in their back yard – and I hope they don’t send them to slaughter or kill them but just eat the eggs, but it is not good to encourage people to think that eating eggs is a) healthy and b) cruelty free.  Are you vegan or not?  Just wondering because if not we will give away your recipe book.

I’ve noticed that several of your recent recipes have featured eggs.  I know the blog has evolved over the years, but seems to have been almost exclusively GF and vegan for the last while.  Is there a reason you’ve started including eggs in recipes again?  Just curious.

Hi Becky, sorry for any confusion. This year we have decided to begin broadening the scope of our recipes beyond strictly plant-based not only to accommodate more people’s dietary needs, but also in order to be more transparent about the way my diet has shifted in the last year to better support my health. 
We will continue to share plenty of plant-based recipes (which can always be found here by selecting the “vegan” option under “Special Diet”). But we will also be sharing some recipes with eggs and meat. Hopefully that provides some clarity.

No worries.  Thanks for clarifying.  I follow food blogs (e.g. Smitten Kitchen) where many of the recipes don’t suit my diet or taste, so I don’t mind if you publish recipes that reflect what you are eating, not just what *I* eat.
