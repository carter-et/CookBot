Roasted Plantain & Black Bean Vegan Bowl

Did you try our 1-Bowl Easy Black Beans from Scratch yet?
If not, do it now! It’s the perfect time to put those gorgeous black beans to use in this EASY, 10-ingredient Roasted Plantain Black Bean Bowl!

The base of this bowl is rice and beans, but the real star of the show in our opinion is the plantains, which are tossed in coconut oil and sea salt and roasted to perfection at high heat. The result is plantains that are crispy and caramelized on the outside and tender on the inside, and they pair perfectly with the savory, spicy flavors in this bowl.



For serving, the sky is the limit when it comes to toppings. In addition to the easy 2-ingredient cabbage slaw, we went for ripe avocado, lime juice, cilantro, and this AMAZING 5-ingredient Habanero Hot Sauce.
It’s super spicy, so watch out. If you’re not up for something spicy, stick with lime juice and guac!

We hope you all LOVE this bowl! It’s:
Hearty
Flavorful
Savory + Sweet
Satisfying
Fiber- + Protein-rich
Easy to make
& SO freakin’ delicious
This would make the perfect meal when you need to feed yourself or your family and friends with something hearty and healthy quick! Once the beans are cooked (or you use canned), your cook time is 30 minutes at most for the rice, which means it’s on the table fast!

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
PLANTAINS


4
large
plantains
(ripe // yellow with brown spots), peeled, and cut into 1/2-inch rounds)


1.5
Tbsp
coconut oil
(sub maple syrup or water if avoiding oil)


1
pinch
sea salt




RICE + BEANS


4
cups
brown or white rice
(or sub cauliflower rice* for grain-free), cooked*


2
15-ounce
cans black beans
(slightly drained)


Sea salt to taste


Ground cumin + chili powder
(optional)




SLAW


3
cups
finely shredded green or purple cabbage


1
cup
finely chopped green onion




TOPPINGS (optional)


Guacamole 
(or ripe avocado)


Fresh chopped cilantro


Lime wedges


Chimichurri


Salsa


Habanero Hot Sauce





Instructions



Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and arrange plantains on a parchment-lined baking sheet.


Prepare brown or white rice according to package instructions. See my preferred methods in notes.


Prepare beans by warming homemade or store-bought beans on the stovetop in a small saucepan and adding salt as needed to taste. Optional: Season with ground cumin and chili powder to taste. Heat over medium heat. Then, once bubbling, reduce to a simmer to keep warm.


Toss plantains with oil (or maple syrup/water) and salt and toss to combine. Then bake for about 15 minutes or until golden brown and slightly caramelized. Set aside.


Prepare slaw by adding shredded cabbage and chopped green onion to a mixing bowl and tossing to combine. Prepare any other desired toppings at this time, such as sauce of choice, avocado or guacamole, or fresh cilantro.


To serve, layer rice, beans, plantains, vegetable slaw, and any other desired toppings or sauces. We went with habanero hot sauce, lime wedges, avocado, and cilantro.


Best when fresh, though leftovers keep stored separately in the refrigerator up to 4 days.









Notes
*Our preferred method for cooking white rice is bringing 2 cups white rice and 4 cups water to a boil (as the recipe is written) and then covering and simmering for ~20 minutes or until tender. *Find our cauliflower rice recipe here.*As the recipe is written, nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with 1/4 avocado and the oil but without optional ingredients or sauces.*Prep/cook time includes cooking rice, warming cooked beans, cooking plantains, and assembling bowls.

Hi, am excited to make this tomorrow. I have dried black beans and I’m wondering how much to make.
Thanks!

Hi Tommy, 2 cans yields ~3 cups beans (maybe a little more). So that would be about 1 cup (or a little more) of dried beans. Hope that helps!

I’m half Puerto Rican/half Dominican living in a Belgium, so this made me miss the Caribbean a bit less. I made this dish today and I absolutely loved it! I pickled the cabbage with a bit of salt, olive oil and red wine vinegar and it was a very nice touch! Thanks so much for all your recipes!

We made this last night and it will definitely be in our rotation of dinners!  So good!   Love eating something the is delicious and so good for me. The plantains came out beautifully just as directed.   I cooked my brown rice in the instant pot with coconut milk and lime juice, and topped the bowls with pickled red onions and cilantro avocado cashew cream.  I also threw in a little sautéed kale for some greens (gotta check all the boxes in Dr. Gregors Daily Dozen).  Thank you Dana for always having exactly what I am looking for!

Hello,
This looks delicious and I can’t wait to try it. I am curious to know if you have any ideas on spicing up the ‘slaw’ with a dressing or something. I have been trying to figure out what I could do differently so that it was not just cabbage and green onions. Figured it would hurt to ask the expert! Any thoughts?
Thanks

I made this for the first time tonight, def won’t be the last!  I have never made plantains before, this was so easy!  I forgot to buy red cabbage, so just threw in green onions. Yum!  I also doctored up the  beans with Lizano and Cholula sauces which I know is kind of cheating but I was improvising a bit.  The next time I make this I will make the hot sauce but if you’re feeling lazy cooking hot sauce in the beans for about 15 mins is a good way to cheat!  I love this website so much !!!!  I love the simplicity which ends up being the most delicious and I never miss meat because the recipes are so well balanced.

I enjoyed this recipe, the plantains added a really interesting dimension! I mixed in nutritional yeast and enchilada sauce to my rice/bean mixture, and it tasted great. One rec may be to flip the plantain coins halfway through, mine totally browned on one side.

This is a 5 star recipe!! I made it tonight and I was a little nervous because my plantains were a bit green but they still tasted great! I added a bit of red quinoa to my brown rice and topped with a rather unlady-like drizzle of sriracha (because I didn’t have the fixins for the sauce)!! DELICIOUS!  I will be eating this for the next 2 weeks, thanks SO MUCH!!

Loved this recipe it was super easy plus delicious, side note all week I have been trying to make brown rice (trying to get away from white rice) it either comes out too soft or under cooked and the way you suggested to do the brown rice was perfect! I also made the habenro sauce that sucker was spicy I only needs a drop or two but still amazing.
 But my question is, my plantains came out dry and stiff. I used maple syrup instead of coconut oil What could have went wrong?

Hi Allie! We’re glad you enjoyed the recipe! Regarding your plantains, it sounds like they may have been underripe. Next time, ensure they are ripe, and you’ll find that it makes a huge difference in texture. Hope this helps!

I made this with beans from scratch (made in an instant pot), and chimichurri (fabulous!!). I used a different slaw recipe but aside from that I stuck to your version. It was delicious! The plantains took longer than fifteen minutes to roast for me, but they were great when done…I then made the mistake of letting them sit in the turned off but still warm oven for a bit after they were roasted though, and this really dried them out…don’t make the same mistake I did!
On another note, I love the new comment/review sorting tabs! And on a last note, I have to say I am stoked to see an entire homepage of recipes that aren’t focussed on chickpeas or sweet potatoes…as a long time follower of your site i had to take a bit of a break as I found that the recipes were starting to get a bit repetative….that being said, everything I make from here is delicious, just personally needed a bit more diversity of choice. Thanks for all you do!

Oh. My. Gosh. This was so good! I just made this and ate it for lunch, and I throughly enjoyed it! I used homemade pico de gallo instead of habanero sauce, water instead of coconut oil, and spring mix since I didn’t have cabbage. This is definitely going into the rotation; it’s so flavorful, simple, and filling.

Hi! I made this– it was pretty good! I topped with a tahini dressing and hot sauce, and when I ran out of plantains a fried egg was a nice addition! Speaking of plantains, mine stuck like crazy to the parchment! I recommend greasing the parchment if you want to eat the delicious caramelized plantain bottoms!

Blaire Pingeton says 
April 11, 2018 at 2:48 pm 

Just an update! I tried them again and greased the parchment paper, and they still stuck, but definitely less so! I used olive oil instead of coconut only because my coconut oil was solid and I didn’t feel like dirtying another dish to soften it.

April 2, 2018 at 11:32 am 

Rosemaree, 
Since plantains are a little on the starchy side, I would suggest using something like sweet potatoes, butternut squash, or you favorite starchy root vegetable. You could roast them in a similar fashion. They all would work nicely in this situation.
Cheers!

I am so glad I learned how to cook brown rice with a lot of water.  It is so much fluffier.  Hard to believe I have been cooking rice and making it sticky with less water.  Great idea with the 10 cups of water.  I don’t even measure it I just put a pan full of water on to boil and then add the rice.

its not a mistake. she’s talking about a “boil” method, like when you cook pasta, most of the time its boiled in a lot of water. thats why she said, DRAIN and serve :) most people try to make brown rice using the taditional rice method which is by absorption, with closely equivalent grain to water ratios but its actually harder to get it right that way with brown rice. the boiling method they’re talking about is way better for brown rice!

I actually make creamy black beans all the time using this method a la Orangette: http://orangette.net/2015/03/the-bean-doctor/. Cook down canned black beans and liquid altogether with hot sauce and garlic, and sub coconut oil for the butter to make it vegan. Really good and it’s like quick coconut-y refried black beans! I think that would be great in this bowl–which looks delicious by the way :)
