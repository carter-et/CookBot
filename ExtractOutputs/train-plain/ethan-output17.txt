                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

These easy vegan black bean burgers have a healthy dose of fiber thanks to the combination of black beans and quinoa. Cumin and chipotle chile powder give these vegan burgers a Southwestern spin. Using your hands to combine the mixture creates a soft, uniform texture. Source: EatingWell.com, February 2020

                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Place beans, quinoa, panko, scallions, tomato paste, cumin, chile powder, garlic powder, 1/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl; mash the mixture together with your hands. Shape into six 3/4-inch-thick patties. Arrange the patties on a plate; refrigerate for 10 minutes.

                                      Step 2
                                    



Combine avocado, lime juice, cilantro, water and the remaining 1/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor; process until smooth, about 30 seconds.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties; cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Divide the avocado mixture evenly among top and bottom bun halves. Arrange the bean patties and tomato slices evenly on the bottom bun halves; replace the top bun halves.







          Tips
                            



To make ahead: Wrap the patties (Step 1) and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
