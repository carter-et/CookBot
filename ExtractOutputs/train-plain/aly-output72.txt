1-Pot Spiced Sweet Potato Lentil Soup


When the weather cools down, we’re in full-on soup mode (and stretchy pants, for that matter).
I’ve always loved Moroccan-inspired dishes. The spices are so comforting and warming.
This Moroccan-inspired soup puts some of my favorite spices, like cumin, coriander, and cinnamon, to use.
Let us show you how easy this 1-pot soup is.


This recipe begins with lentils, which we recommend soaking.
Soaking helps improve digestibility and also speeds cook time.
However, if you’re not one to remember to soak your beans (or grains), you can always buy sprouted at the store to save time and know they’ve already been soaked. I typically buy sprouted quinoa and lentils because they’re frequently used pantry staples that I often reach for in a pinch but don’t always have time to soak.
If you’re in a really big hurry: You could also just use red lentils, which don’t require soaking and cook faster. Or, use canned cooked lentils (just be sure to rinse and drain before adding, and reduce cook time as needed).

The rest of this soup is easy:

Sauté onion and garlic, then add sweet potato and spices.
Add vegetable broth and lentils, and simmer until tender (both sweet potatoes and lentils).
Add green beans (or greens of choice) and cook 10 minutes more.

That’s it!

We hope you LOVE this soup. It’s:
Comforting
Quick & easy to make
Flavorful
Satisfying
Customizable
& Delicious
This would make the perfect soup when you’re craving a comforting, satisfying dinner. Depending on the season and personal preference, feel free to substitute the sweet potatoes for other starchy vegetables, such as butternut squash or white potatoes. And the green beans can be swapped for any sturdy green, such as kale or collard greens.
