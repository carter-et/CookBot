                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

This reduced-sugar jalapeño margarita is a drink with a kick! We sweeten this zippy cocktail with fresh orange juice and just a touch of simple syrup steeped with slices of jalapeño. If you like the heat, add more chile slices to the sugar mixture. Source: EatingWell.com, February 2020

                                      Step 1
                                    



Combine sugar, water and jalapeño slices in a small saucepan; cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and let the jalapeño mixture stand for 20 minutes. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a small container; discard solids.

Combine the jalapeño simple syrup, tequila, lime juice and orange juice in a pitcher; refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Pour into ice-filled rocks glasses; garnish with a jalapeño slice, if desired and serve immediately.
