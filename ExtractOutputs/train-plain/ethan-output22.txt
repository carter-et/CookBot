                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

Total happiness in a bowl: pasta, sausage, tomatoes and herbs. The tomatoes get sweet and tender and turn into sauce with the stock and the pasta. Without ever adding any butter, the spaghetti sauce is rich and silky. Adding the herbs at the end gives the dish a fresh pop of color and flavor. This is one healthy pasta recipe we can definitely get behind! Source: 400 Calorie Recipes

                                                12 ounces cherry tomatoes or multicolor cherry tomatoes, halved if very large
                                            








                                                1 cup chopped yellow onion

                                                2 ½ cups unsalted chicken stock
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon black pepper
                                            








                                                8 ounces whole-grain spaghetti noodles, broken in half
                                            








                                                5 ounces baby arugula
                                            








                                                2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
                                            








                                                2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
                                            








                                                ¼ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high. Add sausage, and cook, stirring often to break into pieces, until sausage is barely pink, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, onion, and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened, about 4 more minutes. Add wine, and cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes, scraping bottom of Dutch oven to release any browned bits. Add chicken stock and pepper, and bring to a boil. Add broken pasta, and stir, making sure pasta is mostly submerged. Reduce heat to medium; cover and cook until pasta is al dente, about 7 minutes.

Remove from heat, and stir in arugula and vinegar. Toss until arugula is wilted, about 1 minute. Spoon 1 1/2 cups into each of 4 bowls, and top each bowl with basil and 1 tablespoon of cheese.
