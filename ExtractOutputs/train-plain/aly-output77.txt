Balsamic Portobello Burgers with Caramelized Onions & Garlic Aioli


Friends, behold one of the tastiest veggie burgers we’ve ever had.
If you’ve never tried a balsamic-marinated portobello mushroom, you probably haven’t lived. Not only are these veggie burgers delicious, they’re also relatively easy to make and require just 10 ingredients! Let’s do this!

These burgers get their flavor from fresh garlic, sea salt and black pepper, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Italian herbs like oregano and basil.
While they marinate you’ll make a simple garlic aioli with roasted garlic for a more subdued, sweet garlic flavor, which complements the burgers perfectly.

You can either grill your mushrooms or cook them on the stovetop — either way, they’re absolutely delicious.
And while that’s happening, you can sauté some onions until caramelized. These will be the perfect topper for the burgers.


We hope you LOVE these burgers! They’re:
Hearty
Flavorful
Customizable
Simple to make
& SUPER satisfying
Pair these beauties with a side of greens like our Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas. Or, go carb heavy with our Crispy Baked Matchstick Garlic Fries. You can’t go wrong either way!

(or sub unsweetened almond milk for creamier consistency)


Salt + pepper
(to taste)

(organic when possible)


3
Tbsp
avocado or olive oil


1/4
cup
balsamic vinegar


1
Tbsp
Italian seasoning 
(dried basil + oregano)


2
cloves
garlic, minced  
(2 cloves yield ~1 Tbsp or 6 g)


1
healthy pinch
each salt and black pepper




CARAMELIZED ONIONS


1
Tbsp
avocado or olive oil


1
medium
white or yellow onion, peeled + sliced into 1/4-inch rings




FOR SERVING


4
whole
wheat hamburger buns 
(ensure vegan-friendly as needed // sub lettuce wraps or GF buns for gluten-free)


2
ripe
tomatoes, sliced 
(optional // organic when possible)


Lettuce or greens of choice
(optional)





Instructions



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and cut off the very top of a head of garlic. Drizzle with a little oil, sprinkle with sea salt, and loosely wrap in foil. Set directly on an oven rack and bake for 1 hour. Let cool before use. Note: To save time, you could buy roasted garlic, or sub the head of roasted garlic for 3-4 additional cloves raw garlic and proceed as instructed.


In the meantime, place cashews in a bowl and cover with just boiling water. Let sit uncovered for 1 hour. Then drain and rinse thoroughly.


While cashews are soaking, use a damp washcloth or paper towel to clean the mushrooms by wiping away any dirt and removing the stems. Place stem side up on a rimmed baking sheet or 9x13-inch baking dish.


To a small mixing bowl, add avocado oil, balsamic vinegar, Italian seasoning, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine, then pour over the mushrooms and use a pastry brush to distribute the marinade. Flip the mushrooms over and brush the other side, then flip back over to stem-side-up position. Set aside, uncovered at room temperature, to marinate (at least 30 minutes).


Add your drained, soaked cashews to a small blender. Take your roasted head of garlic and press out the softened garlic by squeezing from the base up until all of the garlic is extracted.


To the blender also add fresh garlic, avocado oil, water (or almond milk), and a pinch each salt and pepper. Blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more olive oil or water for creaminess or salt for saltiness. Transfer to a serving dish and set aside.


To caramelize onions, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1-2 Tbsp avocado oil, the sliced onion, and a pinch of salt. Sauté, stirring frequently, until light golden brown and very soft (see photo). Remove from skillet and set aside.


Return the skillet to the stovetop (or heat a grill and lightly oil grilling surface). Once hot, add portobello mushrooms — only as many as will fit comfortably in the pan — and sauté for about 3-6 minutes on each side, or until the mushrooms are deep golden brown on the edges and softened/reduced in size (see photo). While cooking, brush with any leftover marinade for extra flavor.


At this time, prepare any serving items, such as browning hamburger buns on the skillet (or grill), slicing tomato, or chopping greens.


To serve, add a generous spoonful of garlic aioli to each bun and top with aioli, then tomato, lettuce (or greens), mushrooms, onions, and more aioli on top of the bun. 


Enjoy immediately. Store leftover mushrooms separately in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days, though best when fresh. Aioli will keep in the refrigerator for 7-10 days.

I made this recipe for my friend and her family who are trying more vegan meals. These were devoured by all, even one who said they didn’t like mushrooms. The aioli was super flavorful, and my friend licked a spoon clean of it. I will definitely be saving this recipe for future meals.

Hi Danielle, you could make a mayo-based sauce instead. We aren’t sure of exact measurements though. Let us know if you do some experimenting!

Just made these for a summer in winter dinner party because sometimes you want to fake a BBQ in January. They were a HUGE hit! Paired with Udi’s GF buns and some tatertots on the side. Super easy, very yummy, light but satisfying!

These were fantastic!! Made them on the grill. I forgot to put the garlic in the marinade and for the aioli I used mayo and just the roasted garlic.

Hands down one of the best things I’ve ever put in my mouth! This will be a staple for years to come. I didn’t use roasted garlic or let the cashews or mushrooms set for any longer than 10 minutes (although I’m sure it would have made it even more lovely) but it still turned out phenomenal! It was much quicker to make than I expected it to be too!

I think it would be helpful to include the exact recommended time for marinating (I was able to find my answer in the comments) as well as exact amounts for salt and pepper for those new to cooking. I did not make the cashew garlic spread, I just mixed some garlic powder into mayo instead. The marinade was fantastic. I was worried it would be too strong and “balsamicy” but it was perfect. I cooked the portobellos in a non-stick frying pan with a lid overtop. They definitely took much longer than 2-4 minutes per side to soften and shrink. I also feel like they would benefit from sitting on some type of drip tray for a few minutes before serving to let some of the juices drain out tnd make eating the burgers less messy. Overall, great experience for my first time cooking portobellos.

You set is great and I have gotten some excellent ideas from it.  I have two Vegan granddaughters and bought ready made plant based protein that is similar to ground beef in presentation. I need some help with how to season this for presentation as a meatless main course dish made with veggies and a rice or mashed cauliflower.  i would appreciate any help you may be able to provide.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I followed the recipe exactly and yes, they were a bit saucy (my fave kind) but I smooshed the shrooms down in the pan with a potato masher (technical stuff!) to get out that extra juice and once removed from the pan added a bit more balsamic to cook off as a glaze. Divine!!!

This recipe was easy to make, it was easy to source the ingredients, and it was absolutely delicious. The balsamic vinegar complements the mushroom perfectly. I substituted sourdough bread for a roll but it would work with pretty much any bread you like.

I made these for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I took a shortcut on the aioli and made it with vegan mayonnaise, lemon juice, and garlic powder. Everything tasted great, the mushrooms were very flavorful! I did cook them for a longer time, I like them well done and caramelized. Will definitely make again!

These are delicious, the flavor on the mushrooms was spot on!  We’d made the aioli with sunflower seeds, adding a little water to loosen the texture and would likely reduce or eliminate the raw garlic next time – otherwise a lovely dish I’d be happy to make again.

My husband and I loved these burgers and I thought everything came together really quickly (I prepped the marinade + roasted garlic earlier in the day). I didn’t end up adding the 2 raw garlic cloves in the aioli and found that to be the perfect touch of garlic when everything was put together. Thanks, Dana!

This was great!  Super easy and very flavorful for so little time/effort!  Re the aioli — I added 2 cloves of raw garlic bc LOVE garlic, and I was a bit worried because on its own it had a very powerful pungent garlic flavor.  However combined with the mushrooms/tomato/lettuce/caramelized onions/bread – it was perfect!   The second day we reheated some of the mushrooms and cut it into slices and made crostini with the aioli on the bottom of the crostini – fantastic!

Hi Dana, have enjoyed making so many of your recipes but this one failed to excite.
The layout of the recipe I found difficult to follow and the end result I felt did not merit the effort. I’m feeling that the marinade needed a ‘how long’ as I don’t think I left it for long enough (over an hour). Also did not like the sauce. But hey! My daughter did enjoy the mushroom burger. Thank you anyway.

I have eaten this before, but only at restaurants. The restaurant’s BALSAMIC PORTOBELLO BURGERS WITH CARAMELIZED ONIONS & GARLIC AIOLI are very well. I hope my mom can make these one day. I have been looking at All Minimalist Baker Recipes for a long time, but haven’t found the one I like the most. My mom used to be gluten-free, but now she is basically vegan so she can’t eat like tons of things and that makes me said to just eat something gluten and hear mom say that she wishes she could eat that. So I am trying to make her something, but don’t know what to use. Do you think you have an idea of what I could use?

I love mushrooms, I love carmalized onions and I love garlic but unfortunately this recipe didn’t do it for me. It was hard to hold together in the bun and it was very wet and dripped all over.  The mushrooms were hard to bite into. I still love your website though and most of your recipes are awesome.

I will say that this was time-consuming the first time (making buns and a 15 minute grocery trip was part of that.  But I’m making it again in a couple of days with guests and I won’t have to do the buns, marinade, or aioli again.  : ) My husband raved about it.

This was super delicious.  I doubled the carmelized onions.  I made the mistake of adding another raw clove to the aioli to make 3 cloves, when I should have decreased it to 1 instead of 2… lesson learned.  I had to mix the aioli with mayonnaise for it not to be super overpowering, sharp garlic flavor.  I look forward to making it again with less raw garlic. I made buns using this recipe (wheat flour and some vital wheat gluten instead of white). I had a lot of aioli left over and enough marinade to make this again in the next few days.
Thanks!
