                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

In the south of France, lamb is often grilled on a bed of fresh rosemary and anointed with citrus juice. This lamb chop recipe takes inspiration from that tradition with a wet rub made with lots of garlic plus rosemary and blood orange. Besides being a beautiful garnish, the charred blood oranges are served to squeeze over the lamb for a final flourish of citrus flavor.

Ingredients



                                      Ingredient Checklist
                                  






                                                2  blood oranges
                                            








                                                6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon kosher salt
                                            








                                                3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus 6 sprigs
                                            








                                                8  lamb loin chops (1 1/2-inch-thick, 1 1/2-1 3/4 pounds total), trimmed
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Zest oranges. Cut them in half and set aside. Mash garlic and salt into a paste with a fork or the side of a chef's knife. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the zest, oil and chopped rosemary. Arrange rosemary sprigs on a plate and place lamb chops on top. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the paste and spread the rest over the lamb. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or refrigerate for up to 2 hours.

                                      Step 2
                                    



Position rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Place the reserved orange halves on a baking sheet, cut-side up. Scatter the rosemary sprigs among the oranges and place the chops on top, not touching. Broil until the oranges are charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a chop registers 140 degrees F for medium-rare, 13 to 15 minutes.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Spoon the reserved paste over the lamb chops. Cut the oranges into wedges and serve with the lamb for squeezing.







          Tips
                            



To make ahead: Refrigerate lamb chops (Step 1) for up to 2 hours.
