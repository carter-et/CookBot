                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

                                      Step 1
                                    



Begin with a clean wooden or marble board that's at least 16 inches in diameter. Position 2 small serving bowls in the center of the board. Fill one with almonds and the other with pistachios.

                                      Step 2
                                    



Wash strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; pat dry with paper towels. Set the berries aside to dry completely.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Wrap each date in a piece of prosciutto and place on the board next to the bowls. Arrange the raspberries and blackberries next to the dates and bowls. Arrange blood orange slices by slightly layering them around the berries. Sprinkle pomegranate arils over the orange slices.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Arrange the dry strawberries in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Coarsely chop chocolate and place in a microwaveable bowl. Microwave on High in 15-second increments, stirring in between, for 1 minute, or until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Allow the chocolate to cool slightly before spooning into a piping bag or a zip-top plastic bag; cut a very small hole in the tip of the bag. Pipe the chocolate onto the strawberries in a zigzag pattern; let the berries stand until the chocolate sets, about 15 minutes. Place the strawberries on the outside edge of the board. Just before serving, drizzle honey over the prosciutto-wrapped dates.
