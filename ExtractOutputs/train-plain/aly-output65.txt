Sautéed Kale with Lemon, Tahini & Hemp Seeds



In our quest to uncover the best ways to make kale taste good, we discovered our favorite, simple way to enjoy cooked kale.
Let us show you how quick and easy this 1-pan sautéed kale is, and which seasonings make its flavor pop. 


It all starts with fresh kale (organic when possible). As for type, we prefer curly kale as it’s a bit sturdier and holds up to cooking better than dinosaur/Tuscan kale.
Simply remove the stalky parts of the stem, chop, and set aside.

Heat a pan over medium heat and add oil, kale, and seasonings of choice.
Our go-to seasonings are a pinch of salt and DIY curry powder. Store-bought curry powder or other spices of choice would work well, too (especially turmeric, cumin, and smoked paprika).

Sauté then cover briefly to steam and wilt the kale. You’ll know it’s done when it’s slightly wilted, bright green in color, and golden brown in spots.

All that’s left to do is top with a squeeze of lemon, hemp seeds, and a drizzle of tahini! Swoon.
This kale is delicious on its own, paired with other cooked vegetables (like roasted squash, sweet potatoes, and carrots), or in breakfast bowls with a fried egg (our favorite!).

US Customary – Metric 
INGREDIENTS


2
tsp
avocado oil 
(sub water if oil-free)


1
large bundle
 kale, large stems removed, roughly chopped
(1 large bundle yields ~5 cups or 335 g)


1
healthy pinch
sea salt


1
tsp
curry powder
(or store-bought // optional)




FOR SERVING


1
Tbsp
lemon juice


1
Tbsp
hemp seeds


1
Tbsp
tahini 
(Check out our Tahini Review!)





Instructions



Heat a large pan (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil and swirl to coat. Wait 30 seconds for the oil to heat.


Add chopped kale and season with salt and curry powder (optional). Toss to coat. Then cover and cook for 1 minute.


Remove lid and stir/toss. Cover again and cook until kale is slightly wilted, vibrant green, and a little crispy in spots. The cooking process should only take about 2-3 minutes total.


Transfer from pan to serving plate and top with lemon juice, hemp seeds, and tahini. Enjoy. Store leftovers covered in the fridge and reheat on the stovetop over medium heat, or add to soups / stews. Best when fresh. Not freezer friendly.

This was delicious. I seasoned with turmeric and cumin then tossed with a sauce I made with the lemon juice, tahini and a little hot water. Sprinkled w hemp seeds as called for. 
A very nice change from basic sautéed greens with garlic.  
Thanks!

I had some fresh Kale from my local Farmers Market.  This was a very simple quick recipe.
I used water vs oil and sesame seeds vs hemp seeds.  I served on top of a plain baked potato.
Simple, quick, nutritious and delicious.  Thank You for the recipe.
