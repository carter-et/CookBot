Roasted Broccoli Pasta Salad with Hemp Pesto (V/GF)



We recently realized that our favorite pasta salad had only been featured in a video and not as a recipe on the blog. That obviously needed to change. The people need this recipe.
Not only is it delicious, it’s also gluten-free and vegan and comes together in just 30 minutes with 10 ingredients! 



It starts with roasting broccoli with olive oil, salt, and pepper until browned and tender.
Then comes cooking the pasta. We like to use Trader Joe’s Gluten-Free Brown Rice Quinoa Fusili as we’ve found it has the best taste and texture without compromising quality of ingredients.

The pesto is made in a food processor by mixing basil, garlic, hemp seeds, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt, then drizzling in olive oil to achieve a creamy paste. Excuse us while we jump in for a swim.

Finally, it’s time to assemble! Add your roasted broccoli, cooked pasta, and fresh pesto to a bowl along with sun-dried tomatoes and macadamia nut cheese (optional). Major swoon.

The result is a delicious pasta salad perfect for make-ahead lunches, potlucks, picnics, or when you’re craving something nutrient-packed and comforting.

We hope you LOVE this pasta salad. It’s:ComfortingFlavor-packedQuick & easyVersatile& Incredibly delicious

Author: Minimalist Baker





Prep Time 15 minutes 

Cook Time 35 minutes 

Total Time 50 minutes 



Servings: 8 (~1-cup servings)


Category:

					Entrée or Side				


Cuisine:

					Gluten-Free, Vegan				


Freezer Friendly

					No				


Does it keep?

					3-4 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
BROCCOLI


2
small heads
organic broccoli, chopped 
(~7 cups chopped)


1-2
Tbsp
olive oil


1/4
tsp
each sea salt and black pepper




PASTA


2
tsp
salt 
(for salting water)


1 ½
cups
(dry) gluten-free pasta 
(we like Trader Joe’s brown rice quinoa fusilli)




PESTO


2
(heaping) cups packed 
basil


4
cloves
garlic, skins removed 
(4 cloves yield ~2 Tbsp)


1/4
cup
hemp seeds 
(or pine nuts)


2
Tbsp
lemon juice


3-4
Tbsp
nutritional yeast


1/4
tsp
sea salt (plus more to taste)


3-4
Tbsp
olive oil 
(if avoiding oil, sub water)




FOR SERVING


2/3
cup
sun-dried tomatoes 
(if in oil, pat dry // we like Trader Joe’s brand)


1/2
cup
macadamia nut cheese
(optional)


1
sprinkle
red pepper flake
(optional)





Instructions



Heat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add broccoli and toss with oil, salt, and pepper. Once oven is preheated, add broccoli and cook for 15 minutes or until lightly golden browned.


In the meantime, bring a small pot of water to a boil and add salt (to season the water and the pasta). Once boiling, add the pasta, stir, and cook according to package instructions or until al dente. Drain and set aside.


In the meantime, prepare pesto. Add basil, garlic, hemp seeds, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt to a food processor and mix to combine. Then stream in olive oil a little at a time until a creamy paste is achieved. Scrape down sides as needed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt to taste, nutritional yeast for cheesiness, hemp seeds or basil to thicken, garlic for kick, or lemon juice for acidity. Cover with lid and set aside.


Once broccoli is roasted, cool slightly then add to a large serving / mixing bowl. Then add cooked drained pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, little spoonfuls of macadamia nut cheese (optional), and red pepper flake (optional). Top with pesto and toss gently to combine (being careful to not break the pasta).


Enjoy immediately or refrigerate up to 3-4 days (not freezer friendly). Enjoy chilled or at room temperature.

My boyfriend said this might be the “best thing he’s ever had” and that’s really saying something!!
It’s so deceiving you good!
I added more lemon juice and a bit of pasta water to make it easier to mix in the pesto. I also did half pine nuts and half hemp! So glorious and healthy.

Hi! This recipe looks amazing! I have a question about the pasta serving size of 1 1/2 cups. The recipe is set for 8 servings (with the broccoli/pesto, etc.), but was wondering if that measurement is off? It seems like a very small amount of pasta for 8 servings. Maybe I’m just a pasta fanatic! Thanks.

Hi Corey, you can enjoy more than that if you’d like! A 1 cup serving is about 224 calories, so that would be more of a side portion. Hope that helps!

If you type in 10-11 servings in the calculator about the recipe, it gives you roughly what you need for a normal 1 lb bag of pasta.

I suspect your site will become my version of ‘Julie & Julia’
I made this tonight without any substitutions and it was fantastic! Never made pesto before and even my husband who is an amazing cook and cooks almost every day, was impressed. Currently he and I are on different culinary paths- he is all pork belly and steak and I’m not- so I was actively looking for easy, healthy dishes that I could make on my own. 
Glad to have found you. I’ll tag and post my pictures.

My husband and I made this last night and couldn’t stop talking about how delicious it was. The fresh pesto is so flavorful and amazing! We used fresh made pasta from the farmers market and it complemented this recipe really well. Can’t wait for the leftovers today! Thank you for always having such delicious recipes on your blog. I started visiting your site when I was trying to learn to cook more things and now most things I make are your recipes.

I made a huge batch of roasted broccoli to use for other meals this week, so didn’t measure out specifically for this recipe. Any idea how much roasted broccoli this recipe would need? Thanks! Excited to finish this up and eat it for lunch tomorrow!

This was so delicious! I served the roasted broccoli and pesto with some quinoa instead of pasta (because I had leftovers to use up) and wilted some spinach through it. The pesto is soooo good and the sun-dried tomatoes add a lovely kick. Sprinkled some of your vegan parmesan on top too. Can’t wait to do it all again tomorrow but with brown rice pasta! Thank you for sharing.

Fresh is best as frozen won’t get crispy in the oven. But it will technically still work!

I realized last minute I didn’t have nutritional yeast. It was still delicious. I used less garlic, like half a clove. We ate it warm as a meal but excited to eat the leftovers cold tomorrow. Thanks for inspiring me to make something besides tacos for dinner.

This has to be the easiest pesto meal to make! So if you’re thinking about it, don’t think just DO IT?  Love that it  is packed with flavor and nutrients. the addition of sun dried tomatoes ties it together, also  I didn’t use much oil, mostly water and it turned out YUMMY!!

Saw this on Instagram in the morning, headed to the kitchen to make it that evening. Pesto, broccoli and pasta are three of the best things in the world so I knew this would be good! I made my pesto with pine nuts and also skipped the tomatoes and cheese. It turned out great! Adding a generous sprinkle of chilli pulls the whole thing together. A great work lunch box.

I’m so excited to try this ! I’m new to the world of sun dried tomatoes so I wasn’t sure if they need to be cooked prior to adding. The ones I am able to find are from whole foods and they come in oil. Thanks for the help !

Hello! If I used vegan ricotta (which I believe from Kite Hill is cashew based) would that be the most similar product to the macadamia cheese that would be store available? Thank you!!
