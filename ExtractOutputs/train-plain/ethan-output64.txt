The Margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in North America—for good reason. Combining the tang of lime and the sweetness of orange liqueur with the distinctive strength of tequila, our classic Margarita strikes all of the right keys.



Although many people reach for premade sour mix, we highly recommend using fresh lime juice. The end result is—let's face it—superior.



When talking Margaritas, it’s easy to get lost in stories about who invented the drink or get mired in debates over salt versus no salt; blended or frozen; triple sec, Cointreau or Grand-Marnier. In our opinion, this version is the tried-and-true recipe for the best Margarita you can make. Memorize it, and you’ll always impress.





































































Ingredients



2 oz Blanco tequila


1 oz Fresh lime juice


1/2 oz Orange liqueur


1/2 oz Agave syrup


Garnish: Lime wheel


Garnish: Kosher salt








Steps





Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice, and shake until chilled.





Strain into the prepared rocks glass over fresh ice.





Garnish with a lime wheel and kosher salt (optional).
