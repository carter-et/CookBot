Cozy Turmeric Porridge (1 Pot!)



When the weather cools down, warm and cozy breakfasts get added to our menu. 
This 1-pot oat and turmeric porridge is perfect for satisfying that craving. 



This porridge starts with an optional step of the soaking steel cut oats overnight to help improve their digestibility (a step we highly recommend for creamier texture, quicker cook time, and easier-to-digest oats). 
The oats are then drained and added to a saucepan where they’re boiled in a blend of water and coconut milk, providing the perfect amount of creaminess.

Then a combination of anti-inflammatory spices are added. We like to use our Golden Milk Mix for a shortcut, but you can also add the spices — turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg (optional), and clove (optional) — individually.
Lastly, maple syrup is added for sweetness and to balance the other flavors.

We like to garnish with pomegranate arils, cashew butter, bee pollen (omit if vegan), and coconut butter to make the porridge even more satiating and colorful. Look at that hue!

We hope you LOVE this porridge! It’s:CozyWarmingEasyDeliciousNaturally sweetened& Made with anti-inflammatory spices

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
OATS


1
cup
steel cut oats 
(soaked overnight in cool water, or for at least 6 hours for improved digestion)


1
pinch
sea salt 
(for soaking // optional)


1
tsp
apple cider vinegar
(for soaking // optional)


Water to cover




THE REST


1 ½
cups
water


1/2
cup
full-fat or light coconut milk
(canned)


1 ½ – 2
tsp
Golden Milk Mix 
(or see notes for individual spices*)


2-3
Tbsp
maple syrup 
(to reduce sugar, sub stevia to taste)




FOR SERVING optional


Bee pollen 
(omit if vegan)


Pomegranate arils


Coconut butter


Cashew butter





Instructions



To improve digestibility and remove phytic acid from the oats, soak overnight by adding to a medium saucepan, covering with cool water by 1 inch, and adding salt and vinegar (both optional). Stir and cover. Soak at room temperature overnight or for at least 6 hours (24 hours max). Once soaked, drain and rinse.


Once oaks are soaked and drained well, add back to medium saucepan with water and coconut milk. Bring to a low boil over high heat. Once a low boil is reached, reduce heat to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until oats are tender and the liquid is almost fully absorbed. Add more coconut milk or water as needed if oats appear dry or are sticking to bottom of pan.


Add Golden Milk Mix (or individual spice — see notes*) and maple syrup and stir to combine. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more maple syrup for sweetness or Golden Milk Mix or spices for more warmth / spice.


Serve with additional coconut milk and enjoy as is or garnish with toppings of choice, such as bee pollen, pomegranate arils, coconut butter / flakes, or cashew butter.


Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding more water or dairy-free milk to thin. Alternatively, store in the freezer up to 1 month. Freeze into individual serving sizes and thaw the night before or cook from frozen on the stovetop or microwave until hot, adding more water or dairy-free milk as needed.

Count me among those who thought “hm, this seems … different than my normal oatmeal” and still made it and loved it! Can’t put my finger on what makes it so compelling, but that’s okay :)
I’m wondering if anyone else has made this as a *baked* oatmeal and if so, what adjustments they made. Yes I know I could just make a batch in advance and scoop out portions, but it’s just easier for me to divide things evenly in a square pan versus round pot.
If no one else has and I take the plunge, I’ll report back on any success!

Wonderful! Thanks for sharing, Sadye! I do think it would work well as a baked oatmeal. Perhaps modify from this one?

I’m always wary of using ingredients that I associate with savory flavors ( I.e turmeric and black pepper for tofu scramble, etc.) but this turned out SO DELICIOUS. I’ve made it twice in the past three weeks with heaps of leftovers because I honestly cannot get enough. I add whatever fruits / seeds / nut butters I have that day and it never disappoints. Coziest breakfast of all time :)

I made this, but used millet instead of oats and I had craisins on-hand so subbed those for the pomegranate arils. Came out great, thank you.

Delicious and comforting! I soaked the oats overnight which made them melt in your mouth once cooked. Added chopped dates and banana to add some additional sweetness (sweet tooth here!) along with all the little add-ons I typically put in smoothies (chia, hemp, goji, flax) and devoured it in minutes. I love that you can add different things each time to bring in some variety and are still getting that necessary dose of turmeric. Thanks Dana and team!

Hello Dana,
I made this for breakfast yesterday and I’m hooked! I love that this recipe is so healthy, so tasty, and so beautiful at the same time. I was wondering how to incorporate daily turmeric in my life and I now have the answer. This morning I made my oatmeal in an instant pot, using 2 cups oat milk and 1 cup water for 1 cup steel-cut oats, a pinch of salt, at high pressure for 4 minutes, then natural release, and it was still very creamy. Like many people, I sweetened it with a sliced banana and the pomegranate arils, and that was all I needed. A royal breakfast! A big thank you for this recipe!

Hi Dana,
This looks great. A lot of your other recipes specify when you can substitute any dairy-free milk for the one written in the recipe. Do you think it would be possible to substitute almond for coconut milk in this recipe?
Thanks!

This recipe turned my usual steel cut oats morning glop into an AMAZING bowl of deliciousness! Recently, I drank my first cup of Golden Milk at a tiny place in Hanapepe, Kaua’i (Little Fish Coffee), and have been wanting to a Golden Milk recipe ever since. Enter your recipe for Cozy Turmeric Porridge! I made mine exactly as your recipe reads, with blueberries & banana for sweetener. Thank you for the deliciousness!

Could this be made in the instant pot or a slow cooker, if so, could the golden milk mixture or spices be added in the beginning?

Hi there! I’d add the spices near the end so they don’t lose their potency/vibrancy, personally. But yes! Instant pot / slow cooker should work!

Do you have to use canned coconut milk? Can you use the regular aseptic or in-the-dairy-section coconut milk? And how about old-fashioned rolled oats instead of steel cut? Thanks.

Reply






Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
January 17, 2020 at 12:33 pm 

I think the milk swap would work! As for regular vs steel cut, just adjust cooking time. And no need to soak rolled oats!

I have been eating turmeric and oatmeal for decades. I prefer a savory route and use a 1/4 tsp of turmeric  and a like amount of ground cumin. Black pepper and Sea salt to taste. My secret twist is to add a slice of quality Swiss cheese when finished cooking and stirring into the oatmeal. I top it with a seeded and diced fresh tomato. If I’m looking for more protein I top it with a poached egg drizzled with EVO and garlic powder. If I’m in a hurry I use McCanns instant oatmeal. OJ is a great accompaniment.
Swiss and turmeric are a wonderful couple and  should get married and have kids or not.

Why do you add apple cider vinegar by soaking the oats?  :)

It helps break down phytates to improve digestion!

Looks delicious! May I ask what the ACV does in the recipe? Is it just for flavour or does it have an added benefit in the soaking?

According to some experts, adding apple cider vinegar when soaking helps break down phytates, which improves digestibility.
