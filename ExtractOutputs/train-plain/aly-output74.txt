2-Ingredient Vegan PayDay Bites


If you’ve followed along for a while, you likely know we have a thing for Snickers bars (and candy bars in general).
Another favorite? PayDays — delicious caramel nougat coated in salty peanuts. What’s not to love?!
These 2-ingredient, 15-minute vegan PayDays are my healthier, vegan-ized take on the classic candy bar.


It starts with adding fresh pitted dates to a food processor along with a little sea salt (optional) for enhanced deliciousness.
The dates get processed into small bits, clump together in a ball, and are then ready to form into bites. We’re already off to a good start.

Next, roll the bites in roasted, salted nuts to give these candies a satisfying crunch!
Any remaining nuts are more finely mixed in the food processor and used to coat the surface of the bites.


We hope you LOVE these candies. They’re:
Sweet
Salty
Crunchy
Naturally-sweetened
Fiber-rich
& So delicious!
These bites make the perfect treat to enjoy this Halloween. They’re also a healthier dessert or snack to have around the house any time of year when salty-sweet cravings strike.

2-Ingredient Vegan PayDay Bites

These caramelly, delicious, 2-Ingredient vegan PayDay-inspired bites are a healthier take on the classic candy bar. Gluten-free, naturally-sweetened, and only 15 minutes to make! 


Author: Minimalist Baker





Prep Time 15 minutes 

Total Time 15 minutes 



Servings: 16 (bites)


Category:

					Dessert				


Cuisine:

					Gluten-Free, Vegan				


Freezer Friendly

					1 month				


Does it keep?

					1 Week				


Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 


1 ¼
cup
roasted salted nuts 
(we chose peanuts and cashews // or sub dessicated coconut)


2
cups
packed, pitted Medjool dates 
(sticky and fresh!* // measured after pitting // 1 cup contains ~19 dates)


1
pinch
sea salt 
(optional)





Instructions



Add nuts to a food processor and pulse several times to loosely “chop.” You aren’t looking for a meal — just chopped. Set aside on a plate or in a shallow bowl.


To the food processor, add pitted dates and sea salt and process until small bits remain or a ball forms. Scoop out ~16 even bites (you can use this scoop!) and roll them into balls with your hands. They will be a little sticky — that’s okay!


Begin rolling date bites into the nut mixture to coat, pressing down gently to encourage sticking. Continue until each date bite is thoroughly coated with nuts. (Optional: To coat even more thoroughly, you can pulse any remaining nuts into a loose meal in the food processor and then roll date bites through again to coat — the finer texture will cause more nuts to stick).


Enjoy as is or transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks or the freezer up to 1 month (sometimes longer). If frozen, let thaw slightly before enjoying.






 

Notes
*It’s important to use dates that are fresh and sticky. If your dates are hard and dried out, try this: Soak in warm water for 10 minutes, then drain thoroughly to bring them back to life. Proceed with the recipe as instructed! *Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated without optional salt and with 3/4 cup peanuts and 1/2 cup cashews for 16 bites.

Hi! First of all this site is my favorite! Second: today my motor burned out of my food processor with the dates, it’s the second time this happened this first one was with the brownies with the dates. I’m torn between getting my food processor repairs or purchasing the one that you linked. Has this happened with that one and all the dates you’ve chopped in it?  Thanks so much for everything

Ya know, I love PAY-DAY bars and I thought, no way is this going to taste like the real thing. Its going to taste like “yeah, I can see why they would describe this as a pay-day.” Then I made them…OMG! thats a frickin’ PAY-DAY! Thank you so much for this recipe! I’m not going to share.

Absolutely Delicious! The recipe worked exactly as directed and was easier than I expected!  I served them as dessert for a group of young people and they all wanted more!  I had to promise to make them again.

I made this as the treat for our Halloween. My husband loves peanuts and dates. I always have them around. He also loved these snack bites, and so did I! I was a Payday junkie when I was younger, and these definitely invoke that sweet candy memory (key element is the SALTED roasted peanuts). So simple and so awesome! Genius idea. I’m looking forward to trying the peanut/cashew combination you mention. I imagine it may give a nougat type effect. Coolness. I love your recipes. Thank you!

My boss was just asking me today who would pick a Payday from the pile of Halloween candy XD I would most *definitely* pick these bites, though–so yummy!

Oh I LOVE the combination of dates and cashews! Would this recipe work with another variety of dates? Honey dates are my absolute favorite and they have a beautifully sweet flavor and sticky texture–they’d work wonderfully in terms of flavor in this recipe!

I went to share this on facebook as I have shared many of your recipes with family and friends however this time I was told I could not share it. I was told it was either unavailable or I did not have the right to share it. My daughter and son-in-law are vegans and they love the recepies I have shared. My 6 year old Great-grandson loves candy so I was trying to share when I I was prevented from doing so.

Thank you! ThAnK you! THANK YOU! Now I won’t have to stare those packages of Paydays down at the register anymore…I added a tablespoon of peanut flour/powder (nothing but ground peanuts) to make it even more peanutier and a little less sticky (I had some super fresh smushy dates and with 19 of them, the consistency  was still wet, maybe mine were oversized) and ate six of these last night! Soooo good, and even though I over ate, didn’t feel guilty or have a sugar hangover this morning. Love this recipe so much! THANK you!!!!!

Unfortunately, I’m not a fan of dates, do you know of an alternate to use cause I love paydays.  I’m trying to cut out sugar in my diet.
Thank you

Hmm, that’s tough. I can’t think of another alternative that’s low / no sugar! Maybe another dried fruit, but that doesn’t help with sugar content. Let us know if you test anything out!

Ok this is perfect because:
1. I feel wasteful when I eat Medjools just straight out of the bag by themselves (cause they’re pricey and also beg to be paired with another flavour);
2. I want a Medjool dessert fast!
Solution: I usually put something in the middle of the date (dark choc, almond, etc) or I search for recipes like this one!
