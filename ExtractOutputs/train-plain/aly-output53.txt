Crispy Breaded Cauliflower Wings



Friends! Welcome to our latest snacking obsession: Crispy Breaded Cauliflower Wings!
Inspired by our Cashew-Crusted Cauliflower “Steak,” these 10-ingredient, grain-free wings have a perfectly seasoned cashew and arrowroot crispy exterior, plus a sweet and spicy glaze so a dipping sauce isn’t necessary. Swoon!



How to Make Cauliflower Wings
 We find making cauliflower wings works best as a four-step process:
Egg wash – eggs are gently beaten with a fork to create an egg wash that is perfect for helping the batter stick to the cauliflower. If egg-free or vegan, you can try subbing non-dairy milk as used in this method.Batter – we used a cashew-arrowroot-salt-spice mix. You want the texture to be a semi-fine meal so that it sticks easily to the cauliflower.Bake – we like to bake at a high temp (425 F/218 C) for ~20 minutes to get the cauliflower wings nice and crispy. Placing on a cooling rack over a baking sheet helps the cauliflower crisp up without getting too brown on the bottom (though both methods work!).Glaze – once the cauliflower is baked, it is stirred into a warm glaze. Doing this after baking allows the cauliflower to stay crispy but also soak up delicious flavor!

These wings will make you want to devour a whole head of cauliflower in no time (sneaky vegetable hack), which isn’t such a bad thing, considering cauliflower is loaded with vitamins C, K, B5, B6, folate, choline, fiber, and SO much more!


These would make the perfect vegetarian snack, especially for Game Day! 
They would also be delicious as a side or appetizer with just about any main, including our Easy Marinated Grilled Chicken or Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burger. 

We hope you LOVE these cauliflower wings! They’re:CrispyFlavorfulSweet & spicySimple& SO delicious!

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
CAULIFLOWER


1
small-medium head
cauliflower 
(cut into even, bite-size florets)


1
healthy pinch 
each sea salt and black pepper




EGGS


2
large
eggs, beaten 
(organic pasture-raised when possible // see notes for vegan option)




COATING


1 ½
cups
raw cashews 
(or sub other nut, such as almonds or almond flour, though we haven’t tested these ourselves)


1 ¼
tsp
sea salt 
(plus more to season cauliflower before coating)


1/4
tsp
cayenne pepper
(increase for more spice)


3/4
tsp
garlic powder


1
tsp
smoked paprika


2
Tbsp
arrowroot starch, cornstarch, or potato starch 
(or try subbing brown or white rice flour, though we haven’t tried these ourselves)


1
spritz
avocado oil 
(optional // from a spray bottle // otherwise omit)




SWEET ’N’ SPICY GLAZE


2
Tbsp
honey 
(if vegan, sub maple syrup)


3
Tbsp
hot sauce or buffalo sauce 
(we like Yellow Bird Habanero for this recipe)


1
pinch
red pepper flake
(optional)





Instructions



Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. If you have a cooling rack that is oven safe, you can place that over the parchment paper; it will help the cauliflower crisp up even more. However, we tested it with and without and both work. The primary difference is when not using a cooling rack, the cauliflower undersides can get a little more brown. But the easy workaround is cooking the cauliflower in the upper third of the oven to prevent the bottoms from burning.


Add cauliflower florets to a large mixing bowl and season with a bit of salt and pepper (pepper optional). Toss to combine and set aside. (Reserve large mixing bowl for use later.)


Crack eggs into a shallow bowl and whisk until combined. Set aside.


Next, prepare cashew coating by adding cashews, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and arrowroot starch (or cornstarch or potato starch) to a food processor. Mix until a semi-fine meal is achieved. A little texture is okay (see photo), but you want it pretty fine so it coats the cauliflower. Transfer coating to a shallow dish (shallow enough to dip the cauliflower in) and set aside.


Dip a few cauliflower florets at a time in the eggs, ensuring all sides are well coated. Then shake off excess. Transfer the cauliflower to the cashew coating and toss until thoroughly coated, using a spoon or your hands to add more coating to any bare spots.


Transfer cauliflower to your prepared baking sheet (with or without a cooling rack). Finally, drizzle or spritz with a little avocado oil to help them crisp up (optional).


Bake for ~20 minutes or until the cauliflower appears golden brown. 


In the meantime, prepare glaze. To a large saucepan, add honey and hot sauce and a pinch of red pepper flake (optional). Heat over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until it bubbles and appears combined. Set aside.


Transfer cooked cauliflower to the large mixing bowl from earlier and top with the glaze. Gently toss to combine, then serve immediately.


Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until hot for best results. Not freezer friendly.






 

Notes
*For a vegan coating, replace the eggs with a mixture of 1 cup unsweetened plain dairy-free milk (we like cashew milk) and 1 Tbsp lemon juice.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated without optional ingredients.

First of all this is absolutely delicious and too easy to NOT make.
Ok so I tried making this the vegan way, with oat milk and lemon juice as my starter. Unfortunately the cashew mixture didn’t really stick to it, and after baking and gently mixing with the sauce, the last of the coating came off. :( So as an experiment, the next time I make it, I’m going to dip the cauliflower into the sauce, then into the cashews. I’m hoping the slight stickiness from the maple syrup will help the cashews adhere better, and then I don’t have to mix a darn thing when they’re done baking. And even if it doesn’t work, I will continue to make this and just scrape up those yummy crunchy bits with a fork at the end. :) Love this, Dana!!

Brilliant idea to use cashews in the coating for crunch. And, they make it a heartier recipe overall. First time I made it I didn’t dry the cauliflower enough and left the coating a bit chunky, so I lost quite a bit in the pan. Still delicious though! Remedied the second time by making it a bit finer. This recipe is a keeper!

Could I use almonds instead of the cashews? I’m allergic to cashews. Or would something else be a good sub?

Made this yesterday and now I’m going to again tonight haha..I did the vegan subs but instead of lemon I did apple cider vinegar and it worked fine! I do have a question though…halfway through the mixture got clumpy and it was hard to stick to the cauliflower. I was thinking of just throwing it back in the processor with a bit of chickpea flour or something of the sort so it’s dry again, will this work? Hope I’m making sense!! Anyway, love the recipes Dana!!! After all these years you’re still my favorite blog/person. ?

Aw, thanks Elisa! That might work? Or for next time, you could try putting the breading in two separate bowls to minimize the exposure of the whole mixture to the liquid. Hope that helps!

This was absolutely, finger-licking delicious! I find raw cashews to be very expensive, so I used almond flour and they were still amazing. A bonus when using almond flour is that you can skip the food processing step. I’d give this more than 5 stars if I could!

I soak my raw cashews and then dehydrate them. Can I use those or do they have to be raw?

Hi. 
I’d like to try this but don’t want a spicy glaze. What else could I use instead of the hot sauce?
Thanks!

Hmm, BBQ sauce and skip the honey if it’s already sweet? Korean Gochujang sauce would also be good and isn’t too spicy.

This looks amazing. I’ve never gone wrong making any of your recipes; thank you for what you do! One question on this one… trying to cut down on calories and fat currently, and wondering whether you think this would work to switch out the cashews with something like crushed corn flakes?

Great recipe! I subbed ground roasted sesame seeds for cashews and brown rice flour for arrowroot out of convenience, and the result was great! I baked most of it as directed, and pan fried the remainder that wouldn’t fit on the pan with some firm tofu.
I used the glaze on the pan fried version, and had a hemp ranch dip for the oven baked cauli. I would definitely make this again, and will try it with other veggies too.

I made these last night, and they were delicious. My kids loved them, and they aren’t huge cauliflower fans. I used cornstarch instead of the arrowroot, because it’s what I had on hand. I also used salted cashews and added less salt to the coating. Using a cooling rack, really helped the bottom of these crisp up! This recipe will be in heavy rotation at my house.

Great flavors! I made these vegan using dairy milk/lemon as suggested. Tasted great. I found that I had way too much of the cashew mixture (even for a bigger head of cauliflower) and not enough glaze (I made a second batch of glaze). If making again, I would use half the cashews and make twice as much glaze.

Ideally yes, because already roasted cashews may burn in the oven when baking. Let us know if you try it!
