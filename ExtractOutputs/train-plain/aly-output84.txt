30-Minute Tempeh Stir-Fry


Everyone needs a good, classic stir fry recipe in their back pocket for quick lunches and dinners, and I think this should be the one.
It comes together in just 30 minutes, uses up leftover grains and vegetables from the week, is rich in protein and fiber, and delivers big flavor. What’s not to love? Let me show you how easy it is to get this dish on the table.

It all starts with marinating the tempeh. Cube your tempeh, mix with your peanut-coconut aminos (or tamari) glaze, and set aside. While that’s happening you’ll prep your other ingredients.


Once marinated, sauté your tempeh on both sides until golden brown and delicious. Then you’ll add your veggies and grains and stir-fry until crispy and browned before adding your tempeh back to the pan to warm. That’s it!


We hope you LOVE this stir fry! It’s:
Quick & easy to make
Incredibly flavorful
Vegetable-packed
Protein- & fiber-rich
& So delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something hearty and nutritious on the table fast. I also love making it for lunch when I want something fast and filling.

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
GLAZE


3-4
tsp
chili garlic sauce 
(adjust to preferred spice level)


4
Tbsp
salted creamy peanut butter 
(or almond, cashew, or sunflower butter)


4
tsp
sesame oil 
(if avoiding oil, sub water)


1/3
cup
coconut aminos 
(or sub slightly lesser amount of tamari to taste as it can be more pungent in flavor)


4
tsp
lime juice


3
tsp
freshly grated ginger 
(or sub 1/2 tsp ground ginger)


1
tsp
maple syrup 
(plus more to taste)


3-4
Tbsp
water




TEMPEH


8
ounces
tempeh
(chopped into large, bite-size squares // if GF, ensure gluten-free friendly)




THE REST


4
tsp
sesame oil 
(or sub double this amount in water)


2/3
cup
chopped green onion


4
cups
mixed chopped vegetables 
(we used red bell pepper, broccoli, carrots & kale)


4
tsp
coconut aminos 
(or tamari)


3
cups
leftover cooked quinoa,* brown rice,* or uncooked cauliflower rice*





Instructions



Prepare glaze by adding chili garlic sauce, peanut butter, sesame oil, coconut aminos (or tamari), lime juice, fresh ginger, and maple syrup to a small mixing bowl. Whisk to combine.


Add water until a thin, pourable sauce is formed. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, or coconut aminos for saltiness. Don't be shy — you want this quite flavorful.


Add the chopped tempeh to the glaze and toss to coat. Then cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes (or cover and refrigerate up to 24-48 hours). Prep your other vegetables and toppings at this time.


Heat a large rimmed cast iron or metal skillet over medium heat. Once hot, spoon in the tempeh, reserving most of the glaze in the bowl (set aside for later). Sauté for 3-4 minutes, turning on each side until browned. Then remove from pan and set aside.


To the still-hot skillet add sesame oil, green onion, and mixed vegetables (if adding greens, wait to add until step 6). Season with a bit of coconut aminos (or tamari) and stir to coat. Cover to cook and steam the vegetables, stirring occasionally until slightly golden brown and tender (about 4-5 minutes). If they stick to the pan, add 1-2 tsp of water to loosen.


Once the vegetables are nearly done, add your greens and grains and sauté for 3-4 minutes or until warmed through and slightly browned. Then add in the cooked tempeh and the rest of the glaze and stir to coat. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until everything is hot and well incorporated.


Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. If freezing, store in the freezer up to 1 month. Let thaw before reheating in a hot skillet with a little sesame oil.

Made this tonight! So good! My daughter was surprised , impressed and very thankful! She loved it!  Loved how the tempeh browns up.  Think next time will cut it even smaller or even crumble to get more goodness covering more of it.  I used what I had, mushrooms, red pepper, broccoli , carrots and green onion.  Broccoli really gets the flavor in it  thank you so so much for this amazing simple recipe!  (We also did not add the quinoa but served the stir fry on top of it.  )

Damn it so hubby didnt like the tempeh I keep trying to sneak it past him in various recipes over the years without telling him and he is just not a fan. I guess it reminds him of nutrela or soya that they eat in India where he grew up. BUT he really liked the flavors here so I will be repeating this with perhaps some tofu or edamame beans perhaps. I love tempeh tho sl I am a bit sad that I cant get it past him lol. Also on another note I used tahini in place of a nut butter and sriracha instead of chili garlic sauce as thats what I had and it was still insanely good. Even my toddler who likes zero spice ate some. Thx for another yummy vegan recipe!

Very flavorful!  The only thing I felt it needed was some peanuts for a little crunch.  I cooked some raw peanuts in a few drops peanut oil and sprinkled them over the top.  This is such a great recipe and I look forward to making it again and again.

I originally had pulled up a different recipe, but I had a few spare minutes for meal prep and decided to make the sauce. I realized after I made it that it was a different recipe – your recipe. What a happy, happy mistake. I used  to struggle with the chewy texture of tempeh until I started to steam it for 15 minutes. After steaming I let it marinate for the day.  So versatile, I used zucchini, mushrooms, red pepper and the green onion. We will be making this again for sure. Thank you!

This was my first attempt at tempeh. I loved the taste, but I scorched the exterior pretty badly. I was sceptical about sauteeing the tempeh with the sauce and no oil…I had a well seasoned cast iron skillet but it immediately stuck although I heated pan first. I removed it to a non-stick skillet, but after one minute on low it burned some more. I still ate it but the carnivores opted for air fried chicken nuggets (ugh). They loved the sauce and veggies….I  used the same ones you used. I will try again, but I’ve never had luck with tofu marinated and sauteed…the sauce was pretty thick on it though I’d thinned it out. I guess I just need to keep experimenting because the flavors are excellent.

Excellent recipe! I’m only about 2 months into my Vegan journey and I’m sure I’ll make this recipe many more times. As with every recipe I learn something new, this attempt was no different. Initially my iron skillet was way too hot and I burnt some of the tempeh but no worries I simply scraped it off and proceeded.
Bc I used only 2 cups brown rice I added Shirataki noodles, added a nice twist. Looking forward to using this great glaze with other dishes, thank u!

Wow! I’ve been looking for a great tempeh recipe. This was so good. I only had soy sauce so used that instead of aminos and siracha instead of chili garlic sauce. I used almond butter and whatever veggies I had around.   I mixed it with leftover quinoa and I am so happy. I am super satisfied and my house smells incredible. I don’t write reviews very often. This one was worth taking the time to say thanks!

I was looking for something new and different to do with tempeh and came across this recipe. I substituted almost everything to use what I had on hand, and this still came out tasty! The tempeh fried up deliciously crunchy. I used Newman’s Own peach salsa with 2 cloves of chopped garlic added, sunflower butter, olive oil, tamari with a touch of smoke flavoring, lemon juice, ground ginger, maple syrup, a light touch of ground chipotle pepper for the glaze in about the proportions indicated. I fried the tempeh until it looked like your photo, stir fried my veggies, added the rest of the glaze and cooked a bit more then added the tempeh back in. Served on brown basmati rice. Everyone liked it. I’ll definitely make it again.

Made this for dinner tonight. It took a little longer than 30 minutes (I’m a slow chopper) but it was absolutely worth it. Peanut-buttery goodness all around. Had it with leftover brown rice tonight and I’m going to try quinoa next. Thanks for another great, simple recipe!

I just made this and have some not so positive feedback. Some modifications: I substituted siracha & garlic for the chili-garlic sauce and a tad less peanut butter than called for because that was all I had. I don’t think these changes made a difference, since the flavor was pretty good.  So here goes. I wouldn’t consider this a quick weeknight meal unless you are using pre-cut veggies. It took me an hour to make this and I am an experienced cook. Second, it is tough to fit 4 cups of veggies + greens and 3 cups of grains into a large cast iron pan and still be able to stir. I had to transfer to my oversized sauce pan. Not a big deal. Finally and probably most importantly, the addition of quinoa made this go completely south for me.  It basically turned to veggies mashed together with quinoa. The tempeh was lost. The dish didn’t even need the quinoa.  Without it there would have been enough sauce but it turned into a big mushy mess.  Sorry!

Hi Linda, We’re sorry to hear this didn’t turn out for you. We are surprised since we haven’t had these problems and other readers seem to love it! Perhaps your pan was smaller? We prefer this one. You could certainly leave out the quinoa, if desired! Better luck next time!

It was an MB week at my house!  I made your portobello mushroom pizzas, eggplant parm, and rounded out the week with this tempeh stir fry.  Wow, this stir fry was delicious!  I absolutely loved the tempeh glaze and let it marinate the tempeh overnight.  The veggies I used was broccoli, bell pepper, carrots, green onion, and a zucchini from our home garden.  This dish is so versatile, and I love the idea of using it when you need to “clean out the fridge” and you can customize it with lots of different veggies.  10/10 will make again!

This has been in super heavy rotation since the day I first tried this! I have been waiting for this recipe all my life I think. I have used basmati rice and quinoa – I like the rice better even though I love quinoa.  I usually just crumble half a block of tofu in instead of marinated tempeh. So easy.  I keep the chili sauce out of the sauce so it’s not too spicy for my 3 year old, and my husband and I just  drizzle it on top after serving. Sometimes we add toasted cashews if we’re feeling extra.

I think I already gave a review of this recipe but I had to give another because its that’s good. Since I first made this recipe about 3 months ago I’ve been making it at least once a week. Its quick, easy, tasty, and filling. It works for either lunch or dinner. I grill the red bell pepper, red onion, and Anaheim pepper after the tempeh has cooked for a bit and then add in shredded carrot, cooked quinoa, green onion , and the leftover marinade after I turn the heat off. I top with kimchi, vegan mayo, sesame seeds and cilantro.

I just made this for the first time to take to work for lunch throughout the week! I must say this is one of the best recipes I have ever made and it will definitely be in my meal prep rotation. Some of the marinated tempeh did not make the final cut as it was impossible not to snack on it while the veggies were steaming… The veggies I used were kale, red and green bell pepper, squash, zucchini, carrot, and onion. SO GOOD!

If you prefer the flavors to be more subtle you could certainly sauté them before adding to the sauce. But in this application they’re only lightly cooked so the flavors are more vibrant!

Hello! I was about to make this recipe, then I asled myself something.
I have neither cauliflower rice, nor do I have brown rice. I am also uncomfortable with quinoa, because whenever I cook it, it tastes like dirt – litterally as if we sprinkled some dirt on them, or as if it wasn’t washed well.
Is it great with basmati rice too?
Thanks!

I was looking for a tempeh recipe with lots of veggies and gave this a shot. Pleasantly surprised, although I felt it was missing a few elements, hence 4 stars.
I used 2 tsp of the chili garlic sauce (because you can always add more), soy sauce instead of tamari, and a bag of frozen stir fry veggies instead of fresh. I also used 1/2 almond butter and 1/2 peanut butter. Next time I’ll use 100% crunchy peanut butter for a richer flavor and texture, which this recipe needs. It’s pretty much ALL softer foods, and although I liked it, it was a bit…homogenous. There was no crunch aside from the water chestnuts in the stir-fry mix. And yes I realize that starting with frozen veggies was going to add more moisture, so next time I’ll leave the lid off so there’s more sauteing (for crispier veggies) and less steaming (for softer veggies). I might even try baking the tempeh so it’s a little more interesting to chew. I’ll probably crush some peanuts and toast them to sprinkle as a garnish, too. And maybe add some fresh cilantro, because c’mon, it’s stir fry.
I’d also urge cooks to use sesame oil, not olive or canola. There is a nutty flavor to sesame oil that’s just perfect in the sauce. I’m sure peanut oil would also be delicious. My husband really, really enjoyed this dish and I know I can elevate it to something I’ll enjoy just as much as he does. It’s a very well-written & versatile recipe, and I’m already looking forward to experimenting with it again.

This was incredible! Be warned if you, like me, have a fairly low tolerance for spicy food – I only used 2 tsp of chili garlic sauce, and that was just about as spicy as I could have possibly handled, but it was still DELICIOUS! I also used closer to 2 cups of quinoa instead of 3 because the proportions looked about right at 2, which could have been a factor in the spiciness level. Overall though, what a flavorful, healthy, and filling meal!

A solid weeknight dinner recipe. I’d add a little more peanut sauce next time. I pretty much followed the recipe, but minced a garlic clove and added red pepper flakes in lieu of the garlic-chili sauce, and subbed a smaller amount of tamari for the coconut aminos.

OMG. I made this for dinner last night and it was amazing. Mixed it with cauliflower rice and this was one of the best meals ever! I normally am not the biggest fan of tempeh but I let it soak in the sauce Overnight and that made a world of a difference. My husband and I were scraping our bowls to get every morsel out.

My adjustments were minor: I omitted the sesame oil, used tamari instead of coconut aminos (as my aminos were flavoured) and used baby spinach instead of kale. I’m making this again today, and will use kale, but the baby spinach works really well too. 
I love recipes like this, meals that can be used for lunch or dinner, and made in bulk for meal prep. I would love to see more of these. Thank you!!

Made this as the recipe stated, and it was Delicious!  Spicy, tasty, very satisfying.  My mega-carnivore husband repeatedly said he liked it and would like to have it again.  Wonderful!  The sauce/glaze is so yummy that I’ll probably increase the amount next time (although will leave the heat the same–it was perfect).  Thank you!

This recipe was super simple, and SO DELICIOUS! I even messed up by under-cooking my rice, and I still ate the whole bowl because everything else was so yummy. I will DEFINITELY be making this again, in the very near future.

I made this as directed,  (used almond buttter and rice)and it tasted good. But.,,,strongly recommend that the tempeh is cut into small cubes – no more than an inch square.  Due to the marinade, it blackens easily, so lower heat a bit. I have had more sucess browning the tempeh first, and then marinating.  My vegan family was not impressed.

Dana,
I have always been suspicious of tempeh, so bland, so naaaahhh, but this recipe of yours just NAILED IT! Oh I can’t stop eating, it’s so delicious. The layering of flavours is just perfect. I used more vegetables: bok chow, red pepper, broccoli, green onions and kale. I overcooked the kale (darn) so I won’t be posting a picture anywhere because the colours are a bit off, but the flavour is to die for. My stovetop is now a mess but it’s so worth it!!! You’re the very best, Dana.

My husband and I both loved this. We marinated the tempeh for the minimum time, used a little extra chili garlic sauce, and choose red bell pepper, shredded carrots, broccoli, spinach, and shiitake mushrooms for our vegetables. We probably had 5-6 cups of vegetables rather than the 4 and it worked well other than my 10-inch see was almost overflowing. This is going to be a go-to easy, healthy meal for us.

Recipe was alot easier to make than I thought it would be. My husband is a meat and potatoes man and recently agreed to “lean” into plant based. He’s been open minded and has been trying, tho I can see it’s not his favorite. However last night he got up from his seat walked around the table and kissed me. He said this is the best thing I’ve made since we started this way of eating. He LOVED the flavors in it and said it’s a definite make again meal!

This was AMAZING.  I used tamari and it somehow was too salty but tasted amazing on the quinoa/brown rice mixture I made.  The veggies I used were rainbow carrots, chopped kale, mushrooms, zucchini (I forgot onion).  I’m adding this to my weekly recipes.  I’ve only ever had tempeh this good one other time.  It charred quickly in the stainless steel pan I had on medium high heat w cooking spray and was phenomenal.  Great recipe!!

I just want to say that I love the recipe interface. The ability to switch to metric, and the inclusion of info on keep and freeze times is just brilliant. Thanks! 
A quick question: Will there be a great loss of flavour if the sesame oil is omitted? If so, can you recommend something to replace the flavour? (This saves me 120 calories per serve).
Thanks :-)

This was yummy! A bit longer than 30 minutes (closer to 60), but that’s mainly because I’m quite a slow cook. Since I’m not vegan or gf, I used soy sauce and honey in place of coconut aminos and maple syrup. I also subbed 2 garlic cloves and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for the chili garlic sauce. Super delicious!

My two year old and I are chowing down on this right now and enjoying it immensely! Since hubbie isn’t a fan of soy I subbed with “chicken” seitan and then used onions and broccoli for the veggies. It goes beautifully with quinoa and has a nice spice to it (so I’m especially pleased that the baby likes it). Definitely a repeat dish!

Hi Claudia :) you don’t necessarily have to boil or steam tempeh before use. Some people recommend this because it can help counteract some of the natural bitterness that tempeh has. You can definitely do this if you would like, but I’m guessing with the bold flavors of the glaze in this recipe it’s probably not necessary.

Subs for tempeh, anyone? I am thinking chickpeas? Paneer? Or just more veggie? Unable to get tempeh here (India)

Casey Mullen says

You could substitute tofu if you’re able to get that. If not, you could try making Burmese tofu from scratch, which is just made from chickpea flour and water. Otherwise, you could definitely substitute chickpeas.

Subs for chili garlic sauce, anyone? Subs for maple syrup?  Thanks :)

Reply






Casey Mullen says 
January 15, 2019 at 12:52 pm 

For chili garlic sauce, you could use sriracha. Or even just some chili flakes and minced garlic. Chili garlic sauce is basically just a mix of vinegar, chili flakes, garlic paste, and sometimes a little sugar. You can easily DIY it if you want :) for maple syrup you could substitute any liquid sweetener, like honey, brown rice syrup, coconut nectar, agave nectar, etc. If you can’t get ahold of any of those, you could probably just use a little bit of brown sugar.

You don’t need to boil tempeh! It just needs to be cooked, which you do when sautéing. If you want though, you can steam it for 10 minutes, which supposedly helps remove some of the bitterness. But, it’s totally optional.
