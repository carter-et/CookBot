Herb Baked Fish with Rainbow Bell Peppers


This recipe is inspired by a cooking class I recently took in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where I learned to make a number of dishes including this gorgeous herbed baked fish with rainbow bell peppers.
The recipe preparation is simple and requires just 10 ingredients. Let me show you how easy it is to make this light, flavorful dish!

To start you’ll cook your onions, peppers, and tomatoes down until they’re soft and just tender. They’ll be added over top the fish later and baked, which creates a vibrant top layer and also creates a sauce for the fish.



Next, you’ll season your fish with oil, salt, a little lime juice, and a blend of herbs. Use whatever you hand on hand — we went with basil, cilantro, rosemary, and thyme.

After a quick sear on the stovetop, you’ll transfer to a baking dish, then top with the cooked peppers. After a short bake in the oven, dinner’s ready!

We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s:
Colorful
Flavorful
Versatile
Light
Satisfying
& Delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal to have anytime of year, but it’s especially great for warmer climates or weather. Pair with a glass of white wine and brown or white rice, Green Rice (pictured below), Green Cauliflower Rice, Crispy Smashed Potatoes with Vegan Pesto, Lemony Arugula Salad with Crispy Shallot, or Socca Pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Pesto!

Herb Baked Fish with Rainbow Bell Peppers

Flavorful, flaky baked white fish made with bell peppers and fresh herbs. An impressive yet simple dish with just 10 ingredients required.

					1 month				


Does it keep?

					2-3 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
FISH


1 ½
pounds
flaky white fish, skin removed
(we used Pacific cod // we think shrimp or even chicken could work here as well — just make sure it's fresh!)


2
Tbsp
avocado or olive oil


3/4
tsp
sea salt
(or enough to season both sides well)


1/4
tsp
black pepper 
(a light dusting over both sides)


1
cup
fresh chopped herbs 
(we used fresh thyme, basil, oregano, and rosemary — go for whatever you have on hand)


2
Tbsp
lime juice




VEGGIES


1
Tbsp
avocado or olive oil


1/2
medium
white, yellow, or red onion


2
medium
tomatoes, stems + core removed, sliced into thin wedges


3
cloves
garlic, minced


4
medium
bell peppers, seeds + stems removed, thinly sliced lengthwise 
(we used green, yellow, orange, and red)


1/2
tsp
sea salt
(plus more to taste)


1
pinch
black pepper




FOR SERVING optional


Lime wedges


Cilantro


Green Rice or Green Cauliflower Rice





Instructions



Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190C) and set out a 9x13 (or similarly sized) baking dish.


Add fish to a shallow dish or plate, drizzle with oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, herbs, and lime juice. Toss to coat and set in the fridge to marinate.


Heat a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, tomatoes, garlic, and bell peppers. Season with salt and pepper and stir to coat.


Sauté, stirring frequently, for 8-10 minutes, occasionally covering to allow the peppers to soften. Stop when the peppers are tender but not yet mushy. Set aside.


Heat a large skillet (cast iron is best) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add fish. Cook for 2 minutes, then carefully flip and cook for 2 minutes more. You aren’t looking for the fish to be completely done — just seared on the outside.


Transfer fish to your 9x13 (or similarly sized) baking dish. Top with sautéed peppers, tomatoes, and onion and spread the veggies to achieve an even layer.


Cover with foil and bake for 10 minutes, then remove foil and bake for 3-5 minutes more to allow the top to get slightly browned.


Remove from oven and enjoy. Delicious on its own, or served with Green Rice, Green Cauliflower Rice, cauliflower rice, brown rice, or white rice.


Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Or add to freezer-safe tupperware and freeze up to 1 month (though best when fresh). Reheat in the oven or microwave until warm.

I made this with halibut and it was absolutely delicious! I ended up using one pan to saute and then bake and it was brilliant. I’m wondering if you or any followers have made it with salmon?

We have frozen and reheated the fish successfully! If you plan to freeze and reheat the veggies, we would suggest slightly undercooking them so that when they are heated they do not get soggy. Hope that helps!

I might skip transferring the seared fish to a baking dish and instead bake it in the cast iron skillet after topping with the veggies. Any reason not to do it that way?

Hi Dana, 
As a fellow vegan, I have recently been toying with the idea of incorporating eggs and fish back into my diet, as I feel it may actually be better for my health. 
I’ve been mainly vegan (minus Ben&Jerrys) for a few years now, and am struggling to re-incorporate these things into my diet. They seem ‘scary’, and I am struggling with the implications of eating animals and animal-by-products again. 
As a dedicated reader of yours for many years now, I would highly appreciate hearing about your journey and decision. I believe it would be very educational for many vegans (myself included) who may be toying with similar thoughts and experiencing similar health issues. 
All the best and looking forward to making many more of your dishes, 
Bronte Goldberger

Bronte, thanks for the honesty and thoughtful feedback. I’ve considered sharing more about that and may sometime in the future. Ultimately, what type of diet to eat is everyone’s personal decision to make so it may just require more time and experimentation on your end to make the switch.

A says

Bronte – Can I ask if you ever decided to add eggs and fish back into your diet? I’m in the same situation as I’m struggling with digesting most plant based foods. I have seemed to have developed IBS and I suspect it’s because of excess carbs and certain sugars in beans. I have added eggs back but am struggling with fish. I went vegan for ethical reasons so the idea of eating them is terrifying to me but I’m having a hard time getting protein and good fats in without major digestive issues. I’m also struggling with justifying fish over other animals because I would never be comfortable eating mammals again. Just thought I’d ask since I’m too nervous to ask the vegan community if anyone has made any changes.

Hello A!
Thank you for reaching out. It sounds like we are very much in the same boat. 
I have been vegetarian/vegan for roughly a decade. While I am luckily not having IBS issues, my joints feel chronically inflamed, I have lower energy and find it difficult to feel full and ‘vibrant’. At 25 years of age, I think it may be time to incorporate more omega-3/6 foods with higher protein content and see if that will help. 
I too went vegan for ethical reasons and this is the main reason I am struggling to incorporate these foods back in. Here is my plan of action:
1) Eat one bite of fish every time I am out with my friend/parent/boyfriend when they order it. The goal is to try and get the taste back for it and see how I like it cooked. 
2) Research ethically sourced fish, and which fish is seasonally available based on the Ocean-Wise standards (http://seafood.ocean.org/)
3) Learn about where the food is coming from, and try to ‘balance’ out my conscience by donating to charities that are working on making seafood industries more sustainable, or have highly ethical practices. 
4) For eggs, I will order them if I am out to eat for breakfast and its labelled cage-free. While I know this is not actually a garuantee, I need to start somewhere. 
5) There are a few nice local food markets where I live so I make sure to buy any eggs and fish (in the future) straight from the source. I feel this is the best way to vote with my dollar about how to source these foods. While it is more expensive, I believe it is worth it.

It is a wonderful recipe of herb baked fish with rainbow bell peppers. This dish is easy to make and includes the simple ingredients. The recipe is explained in a video as well and it includes simple ingredients. It is very delicious and healthy for the non vegetarian people.

Made this tonight along with the green rice. Huge hit! So flavorful! I had fresh shrimp so I used that instead. I sautéed it for a few minutes in olive oil before putting in the pan and covering with the vegetables. Soooo good! Thank you so much! This will be on repeat.

As a pescatarian, I’m excited to see this recipe. I respect the convictions of those who are disappointed, but what you eat is a very personal decision with many contributing factors (health, relationships, beliefs, and so on). I don’t really understand the need to judge and condemn others. And saying you’ll only make vegan recipes from vegan-only websites seems pretty close-minded and self-limiting to me. I frequently encourage my die-hard-carnivore friends to check out vegetarian/vegan recipes and sites, as I think the world benefits from more cross-pollination, and this type of attitude makes it harder to get people to even TRY a vegan meal.  But to each their own!

I couldn’t agree more! I’ve been a dedicated follower of your blog for many years now and I am decidedly flexitarian. I eat a predominately vegetarian diet with the occasional addition of fish, chicken, eggs, or turkey. Your recipes are outstanding and your blog is an inspiration. Please keep sharing your delicious recipes using whatever ingredients that work for you and I will continue to enjoy them. Your choice of what to eat, cook, or blog about is indeed a personal decision and I stand behind you 100%. I choose not to judge what other people eat but to instead focus on my own personal health and wellness journey, and I hope others will follow suit (especially since they can modify the recipes as they see fit). I applaud your courage and kindness in responding to the few naysayers/critics out there. Thank you again for all of the amazing recipes that have brought so much joy to my family and friends. Keep ‘em coming!

I have been a huge fan of your recipes and tried many of them over the years with confidence that the recipes on this site are vegetarian / vegan.  When I saw this recipe posted, I thought that this was going to be a “mock fish” recipe and was disappointed to see that real fish was used. Is there any particular reason that the recipes on this site is going from being vegetarian /vegan to not?
I would like to continue visiting your website and try your recipes however if this is going to turn into another site just with recipes instead of vegetarian / vegan recipes I am going have to remove it from my favorites and not recommend it to anyone else.  Thanks and please go back to solely vegetarian / vegan recipes!

You can, however, take inspiration fro the recipes and turn them vegan yourself. Not everyone can be a vegan, and some health problems just dont allow it. Why not simply support her, because the gave us so many good vegan recipes (and will continue to), and is helpful if you are polite to ask for a vegan alternative.

I think so! One option would be to cook the peppers / tomatoes first, then in a separate large pan or pot sear fish on one side, flip, add the peppers, cover and cook for 5-10 minutes.

I ended up using our traeger smoker in place of the oven, worked very well! The result was delicious limey goodness with some smokey undertones.  The fish was tender and bell pepper was just the right balance of soft and crisp. Thanks for the recipe, pleased the whole family.
I used 1/2 cilantro 1/2 parsley.

I think your recipes are wonderful and really enjoyed them. Therefore, I am sad that I got a recipe which includes a dead animal, since so far I had the impression that this is a site which is respectful of the lives of animals and have been excited  to get the recipes in my inbox. With the highest love and respect, a decision that hurts another living being is not a personal decision. I feel really uncomfortable that instead of opening an exciting recipe (I was thinking mock fish) it’s one that involves a death & the further depletion of the ocean- though we’re taught not see these things or to brand people who mention them as militant or oversensitive. Wishing you all the best.

Ooh, smart idea! I’d say still searing and then baking for at least 20 minutes. Check the internal temperature (165 F for chicken) to ensure doneness, or simply cut into one and make sure they’re cooked through. Let us know how it goes!

Wow, sorry for all the level 5 vegan hate. I’m vegan and semi-creative so I feel like any new recipes can easily be swapped with vegan options without giving you flack or feeling the need to comment. Besides those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. There are about 900 other things that are destroying other species and the planet (ie palm oil, fracking, coal powered electricity, the creation of plastic-an oil byproduct, not recycling every last thing, etc) that all vegans partake in. We shouldn’t judge other people. I love all your recipes and think you are doing a fabulous job providing FREE content. Keep up the fabulous work and I look forward to reading your recipes whether they are vegan or not ;)
