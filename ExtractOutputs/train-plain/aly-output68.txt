All that’s left to do is cook them up on the stovetop until golden brown and serve with desired fixings! May we suggest peanut butter, sliced banana, berries, and maple syrup?

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
PANCAKES


2
small
ripe bananas (yellow with brown spots), ~ 1 cup mashed


2 ¾
tsp
baking powder


1-2
Tbsp
maple syrup 
(or sub stevia to taste // or omit)


1
Tbsp
melted dairy-free butter or avocado oil
(plus more for cooking)


1
tsp
vanilla extract 
(or sub another extract or citrus zest of choice)


2
large
eggs* 
(free-range, organic when possible)


1/2
cup
dairy-free milk 
(cashew and almond are best)


1/3
cup
oat flour
(ensure gluten-free)


1
cup
almond flour 
(not almond meal)


1/4
cup
gluten-free flour blend 
(sub whole wheat, unbleached all purpose, or spelt if not GF)




FOR SERVING optional


Nut butter or vegan butter


Berries, bananas, or other fruit


Maple syrup or raw honey


Seed Cycling Mixes





Instructions



To a high speed blender add peeled ripe bananas, baking powder, maple syrup, melted butter or oil, vanilla, eggs, and dairy-free milk. Cover and pulse a few times until just combined (being careful not to over-mix).


Add oat flour, almond flour, and gluten-free flour blend and pulse again a few times until just combined (a few clumps are okay — be careful not to over mix). Set aside and let rest 5 minutes.


Heat a skillet over medium heat (we love this large cast iron). Once hot, reduce heat to low, add a bit of oil to coat the pan, and swirl the oil to coat the pan. Wait 1 minute for the oil to heat, then pour on roughly 1/4-cup amounts of batter, only as many as will fit comfortably in the pan. Then cover and cook for 3 minutes or until the underside is golden brown, bubbles appear on top, and the edges appear dry.


Uncover, flip carefully, and cook for 3 minutes more uncovered or until the underside is golden brown. Repeat until all batter is used — as recipe is written, about 10 pancakes. Alternatively, store leftover uncooked batter covered in the fridge up to 2 days and cook as needed.


Serve as is, or top with nut butter or dairy-free butter, fruit, and maple syrup or honey of choice. Store cooled pancakes covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Best reheated in the microwave or in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until hot.

So tasty, fluffy and tender! Loved this quick, easy recipe. I Used 2-1/2 bananas (was really hungry so couldn’t resist eating half a banana as I was cooking and threw the extra half in!), then I accidentally added an extra 3/4 cup of GF Baking flour mix, so then added an extra 1/3C almond milk to make it runny enough, and it was all good, just had extra batter left over for next day! Browns up really quickly, and needs to be flipped before you see any bubbles (maybe those bubbles don’t form in this type of pancake?). Five stars.

Hi Trixie, we wouldn’t recommend that as they won’t be as fluffy. Maybe try this recipe for a coconut flour version: https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-banana-egg-pancakes/

Loved these! Replaced the oat flour with some more almond flour (all I had!) and the gluten mix with whole wheat flour. Had almond  butter and blueberries on top and were fantastic. Will be a weekly staple.

These are so fluffy and a big hit! I followed the recipe as written but had issues with the cast iron skillet. The first two pancakes didn’t make it unfortunately. I decided to switch to my nonstick pan and they were perfectly golden! I had to make sure to return the pan to a proper heat before making the next batch. It took a bit longer to prepare but breakfast was worth it.

We’re so glad you enjoyed them, Erin! Is it possible that your cast iron isn’t well-seasoned? We haven’t had any issues cooking these in our pre-seasoned Lodge pan.

I loved these! I made them again last night as a breakfast for dinner situation. The only thing that I did different was add 1/4 cup all purpose flour instead of the gluten free flour. Not sure if it was because of this change or something else but in order for them to get fully cooked, I had to wait a full 8-9 minutes before flipping (with a foil cover). If I flipped earlier they were still slightly undercooked. Not a big issue because they came out fluffy and delicious but something to consider if you want your pancakes done quickly.

Thanks for sharing your experience, Ida! These do take a little longer to cook than your average pancake, but it does sound like the AP flour may have added extra time.

I made these this morning as directed. They would not cook up. The outside would brown and bubbles would be on top, yet they were runny and uncooked, making it impossible to flip over. It was very frustrating.

Support @ Minimalist Baker says

Hi Marjorie, Did you cover to cook the first side? It sounds like either they needed more time to cook before flipping or perhaps there was too much liquid in the batter. You could try adding more flour to the batter or continue cooking. Hope that helps!

Marjorie Hartman says

I did cover my cast iron pan. I could reduce the liquid, but followed the recommended amount. I used Oat Milk.

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
January 1, 2020 at 10:39 am 

Marjorie – sorry these had issues. We’ve never tried these with oat milk so that could have been the issue. Did your milk contain oil? Also, I’d recommend adding a bit more dry ingredients – a mix of GF flour and almond flour – to thicken them up. That helps them cook up a bit better. Hope that helps!

We have been gluten free for 1.5 years and this is the best pancake recipe yet. They turned out so fluffy which is a treat since most are so flat. New family favourite!
Only down side was it took longer to cook with the lid since I used a flat griddle.

These are super tasty! I used Bobs Red Mill GF flour for ease, and added a tab more maple syrup and also sprinkled some cinnamon into the batter. I used a large cast iron skillet, clean and oiled, but mine still stuck to the pan on the edges, and browned on some edges more than others. Not quite Insta-worthy but still tasted great nonetheless.

Just made these with my 3 year old son and they are a HUGE hit. The fluffiest pancakes I’ve ever made. I didn’t have almond or gf flour so I substituted whole wheat for both those measurements and they turned out great. I also added a pinch of salt. They are perfectly sweet without added sweeteners. Thank you for yet another amazing, easy and delicious recipe!

I tried a previous pancake recipe from this blog that uses only almond meal and it was too almondy :)  This one is perfect! I think I need to cook them a bit longer or on higher heat as they came out on a gooey side inside. The taste was spot on though and carbs are still low/ complex. Thanks Dana!

These are the first ‘healthy’ pancakes that my family has liked! I made the recipe as written, but was loose with the amounts (for instance, my two bananas were large, and I didn’t measure the oil, just poured in a bit, etc). Also I did use white flour in place of the whole wheat flour. Otherwise all ingredients were the same, and I did opt for a bit of maple syrup in the batter, but it didn’t need it, they were plenty sweet. They were moist, tasty and beautiful! The key is really cooking them on low and taking your time with them so they don’t burn, but do cook through. Thanks for a hit of a recipe, I will absolutely make these frequently, my 4 year old has already asked that we have them every weekend :)

My first batch burnt as I had the heat on too high (4/6) and when I tried to flip them they were stuck to the pan. For the second batch I lowered the heat to about 3/4 (9 is the highest). The pancakes did not stick but it required much more than 3 minutes (more like 8 minutes) to become golden. I did not have oatmeal and just use flour and almond flour. I also used coconut oil for batter and pan. I also put 3 bananas (so as not to throw away!) and it still worked out well. Finally, my batter looked much thicker than the batter in the video. The kids did love them and ate them happily. Thank you for the recipe!
