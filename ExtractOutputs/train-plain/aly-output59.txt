Fudgy Sweet Potato Brownies (V/GF)



While attempting to create a more nutrient-rich brownie, we ended up creating our new favorite brownie recipe! It’s happening.
Introducing super fudgy, naturally-sweetened, whole grain, healthier brownies made with just 10 ingredients. Let’s bake!



First, we make sweet potato purée by baking a sweet potato, removing the skin, and mashing in a bowl or food processor.
The sweet potato purée is then mixed with maple syrup, almond butter, vanilla, and avocado oil.

Cocoa powder adds a rich, chocolatey flavor, oat flour keeps these whole grain and healthier than your average brownie, baking powder adds rise, and sea salt brings everything together.

Pecans and chocolate chips (optional) are added to the top for morsels of melty chocolate and a little toasty crunch with each bite. We highly recommend!

We hope you LOVE these brownies. They’re:FudgyRichSUPER chocolateyNaturally sweetHealthier than your average brownie& Incredibly delicious!
These brownies are delicious on their own but elevated with a scoop of vegan ice cream (vanilla, salted caramel, and coffee ice cream would all be incredible).

BROWNIES


1
cup
sweet potato purée
(see instructions)


2/3
cup
maple syrup


1/2
cup
almond butter or peanut butter


1
tsp
pure vanilla extract


1 ½
Tbsp
avocado oil
(or sub melted vegan butter, melted coconut oil, or olive oil)


1/2
cup
cocoa powder or cacao powder 
(the higher quality the better // such as this one)


1/4
tsp
sea salt


1
tsp
baking powder


2/3
cup
oat flour
(we also tested almond and coconut flour, and while they did work, we preferred oat // GF all purpose should also work)


1/2
cup
chopped raw pecans (or sub walnuts, but we liked pecans better)


1/4
cup
dairy-free chocolate chips
(optional)




FOR SERVING optional


Vanilla Coconut Ice Cream
(for store-bought, we prefer Luna and Larry's vanilla coconut ice cream)


Salted Caramel Coconut Ice Cream


Vegan Coffee Ice Cream





Instructions



To make sweet potato purée, halve sweet potato and brush the cut sides with oil (optional). Add to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 375 F (190 C) for ~25-30 minutes or until tender to the touch. Move to one side of pan and wrap the parchment paper over top to steam. Let steam for 5 minutes. Then peel away skin and mash in a mixing bowl (or food processor). Set aside.


Adjust oven temperature to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an 8×8-inch baking pan (or similar-size pan) with parchment paper. Set aside.


To a large mixing bowl, add sweet potato purée, maple syrup, almond butter, vanilla extract, and avocado oil and stir to combine.


Add cacao powder, sea salt, and baking powder and stir to combine. Then add oat flour and stir until a thick, scoopable batter is achieved (see photo).


Transfer batter to your parchment-lined baking dish and spread into an even layer using a spoon or rubber spatula. Then top with pecans and chocolate chips (optional).


Bake on the center rack (at 350 F / 176 C) for 28-32 minutes. The brownie edges should appear slightly dry and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out mostly clean (a few crumbs are okay, but it shouldn’t be overly gooey). Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 30 minutes – 1 hour.


Lift out of pan and slice. Enjoy warm or room temperature. Store leftovers covered at room temperature up to 3 days, in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. These brownies are delicious on their own but elevated with a scoop of dairy-free ice cream.

I’ve been looking for a whole foods brownie recipe that is delicious enough to withstand my swapping the cocoa out for carob (this lifetime chocoholic just got the bad news–no more chocolate.  Can you imagine?)  I decreased the maple syrup a bit and doubled the vanilla.  Even the batter was really, really good, and the finished product did not disappoint either! They hit all the right notes– rich, chewy, and utterly satisfying, even with carob.  The nuts and chips on the top are a brilliant touch.  Thank you for this inspired recipe.

I made this recipe today, and the brownies turned out fabulous! I uploaded my photo to pinterest. I used hazelnut butter instead of almond butter because I’m allergic to almonds. Since hazelnuts and chocolate are “good friends,” this change worked well! I will definitely make these again.

Hi Dana, Liam here. My lover Isabelle recommended these brownies, and I bit (her). 
In short, not bad. 
I’m impressed by the flavour profiles of this sugar free, dairy free chocolate brownie. But let’s be real: chocolate (with dairy) and sugar is superior. End of story. But not the end of this story: more brownies and comparisons to be made. Stay tuned.

I substituted the avocado oil out with applesauce, and used regular flour because store was out of oat flour.  Topped with pecans & vegan dark chocolate chips, I shared this for Valentines with my 95 year old Mom, my son and my valentine, my husband.  I served it warm out of the oven with vanilla bean coconut ice cream! It was vegan and deliciously decadent! Oh and they baked perfectly, a little gooey, not a lot…this definitely fit the bill for a special Valentine dessert!

I LOVE this recipe. I have now made it using oat flour, and using regular flour. For the maple syrup I’ve used it as directed and once have to sub in Rosemary simple syrup bc it’s what I had and it worked great, and I’ve used peanut butter and also sun butter. I’ve put the chips and nuts on top and inside. All ways were delicious. I love this recipe I follow it exactly and sometimes I experiment with it a bit. But ALWAYS with the potato.

I have a question. I want to make these brownies with less sugar. I find liquid sweeteners to be extremely sugary, caloric, and not good for my body. I would like to sub in granulated sugar, instead. Can I add that with water, and what would be the specific amount for each?

Hi Sheetal, we haven’t played around with that, but maybe it would work? Another reader mentioned using cane sugar + 2 tbsp of water instead of maple syrup. Let us know if you do some experimenting!

Maybe this will help…I made this twice and used 1/3 cup maple syrup and 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk. They were definitely sweet enough for us. I also used tahini this time instead of almond or peanut butter and this is also delicious.

Delicious! The first time I made this it lasted less than 24 hours! 
The second time I subbed date molasses for the maple syrup, which resulted in a slightly less sweet, denser version. I added a thin layer of stevia-sweetened chocolate ganache from your no-bake brownies. 
I liked both versions, but I think the recipe as written is definitely more of a crowd pleaser.

These are SUPER good, not too sweet or too rich, so very more-ish. Loved this recipe, and made a few modifications based on what I had available to me. I made these with a little less than a  1/2 cup of maple syrup and about 2 tbsp of xylitol. If using a solid sugar, I suggest adding an xtra tbsp of oil (I used coconut) to compensate for the liquid. I didn’t have oat flour so I used sprouted wheat flour and it worked perfectly! I also cooked the sweet potato in the microwave until it was really soft, and worked great. Note: because of the sweet potato it doesn’t have the texture of normal brownie batter, I kind of had to press it into the pan.

If you are looking for these to taste like real decadent brownies do not make these. They taste OK.  I think I am going to stick to making real unhealthy vegan brownies because these do not satisfy my cravings. Texture is great.  Nornally this is my favorite vegan site for recipes. Sorry.

We’re so glad you enjoyed them, Mye! Perhaps there weren’t enough almonds in the Vitamix? If the almond butter isn’t covering the blades, it can have trouble getting smooth. Here’s an ice cream recipe made without an ice cream maker: https://minimalistbaker.com/no-churn-vegan-chocolate-ice-cream/

This looks like a great recipe and I intend to try it. But I did notice it is almost verbatim with a recipe from 2006 or so from a vegan blog called Chocolate Covered Katie. (I am not associated with that blog btw). I assume this recipe was developed completely independently but I guess it would still be appropriate (and supportive of your fellow bloggers) to make an effort to mention and link out if somebody has already published virtually the same recipe previously.

Jay, I appreciate the feedback! There are a lot of sweet potato brownie recipes out there and I can assure you we didn’t modify from that blog. Anytime we modify from someone else’s recipe we always give credit in the notes, if not also in the post. You’ll notice our ingredients and instructions are quite different from hers (for instance she adds a lot of sugar, and ours is sweetened with maple syrup).

Actually it has several distinct differences.  Amount of nut butter and sweetener type are completely different.  Just noting as I have seen several similar recipes on the internet.  This one is not close enough to the one you reference to assume it was copied.

They are baking as I write but won’t have time to taste test til after coaching then supper! Very thick batter so I added more sweet potatoe cause in hindsight I hadn’t measured the purée. I peeled the potatoes so then I did not have to handle them hot and just hand mashed them in a bowl. GF, healthified (see above), and choclately after tonight’s salad supper! Can’t wait..

In the ongoing search for anti- inflammatory ingredients and easier recipes that are also gf and vegan you have become my go-to resource.

These brownies are absolutely amazing! My dad and I made them last night. I’ve made sweet potato brownies in the past that weren’t as incredible so we were a little worried at first. These are truly some of the best brownies I’ve ever had! They’re fudgey, moist, chocolatey, and super rich. I can’t believe they’re made with better for you ingredients. 
We peeled/cut the sweet potato into cubes and steamed them for 10-15 minutes until tender. Then we mashed them into a purée with a fork. We used cane sugar + 2 tbsp of water instead of maple syrup. For the oat flour, we blended 2/3 cup of rolled oats in a vitamix for 15 seconds. We used Trader Joe’s creamy salted almond butter as well. The brownies came out perfectly! They’re so unbelievably good. Thank you MB for another fantastic recipe!

This is an fantastic recipe. I made one batch as directed and a 2nd with half the amount of maple syrup and both turned out really well. Super moist and chocolatey – just like a traditional brownie. I didn’t have pecans on hand but instead sprinkled a mix of ground nuts – pistachio, hazelnut and almond and it worked well. This recipe is a keeper!

I made these with the intention of taking the whole batch to my brother and sister-in-law the other day, but once I tasted a corner of the brownies, I realized it was going to be difficult to part with them! 
They were so fudgy and rich-tasting (I didn’t have any almond butter and was too lazy to go and buy it, so I used tahini, which made the brownies taste like halvah. Not exactly complaining about that!), and tasted even better after being in a Ziploc bag overnight. Hard to believe that, as far as brownies go, these are pretty healthy.
These have unseated my previous favourite brownies (though I still love those!) and will definitely be going into my repertoire of treats!
And before anyone asks, yes, I did manage to spare a few for my brother and sister-in-law, who devoured half the bag in one sitting!

Moist and flavorful.  I substituted agave for the maple syrup since that was what was in my pantry.  I ground oats to make the oat flour. Will definitely make again!

I was excited to make these brownies and they were awesome! They were super easy to make, and the texture was amazing.  My fiancé was very impressed. I did make a mistake of not checking my maple syrup and didn’t quite have what the recipe called for, but the chocolatey fudgey goodness, with the chocolate chips and nuts still made it a treat. I can’t wait to make this recipe again, with the right amount of maple syrup of course!

I made this, along with another dessert for a progressive dinner.  I eat healthy and wanted expose others.  Everyone was very curious and tried it.  All said it was good, worth making again and a couple asked for the recipe.  I think the only thing I’d do differently is put the sweet potato through the food processor so texture is a little smoother.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks!!

Hello! Question~  I’d love to make this recipe, but I want to try and cut down on the calories.  Is there something else you can use besides the nut butter?  I think applesauce would be too wet… hmm… any ideas?  Yogurt maybe?  Or would that change the flavor too much?

I would give these brownies more than 5 stars if I had the option! I made them over the weekend and they were amazing. Thank you for the fantastic recipe! I used cashew butter and olive oil, and only had enough sweet potato for a 1/2 batch, so I baked my smaller batch in a loaf pan. So delicious. I am already planning on making a double batch next weekend and (hopefully!) having some to put in my freezer.

Tip when you’re measuring your sweet potatoes to bake: do more! I weighted around the amount needed, and after I baked it and peeled it, it was 70gr less than initially :(
I urgently cooked some in the microwave so I could go on with the recipe, and it turned out ok! :)
I substituted maple syrup for coconut syrup, and mixed pecans, hazelnuts and walnuts since I didn’t have enough pecans. I also sub chocolate chips for a bit less cacao nibs.
It turned out great, thank you! :)

Oh these are a dream! Tender, light. I’m in love with sweet potatoes so when I saw this in my inbox I had to make them right away, and I’m so so glad I did. This might be my new favorite brownie recipe ? ?
My batter was a bit thick (I used regular ap flour & had mashed the yam with a whisk)– like, spoon-bending, patchy-flour thick– so I added a splash of almond milk and that helped the dries incorporate better. I only have an 8×6 pan so I baked at 345 for 35 mins, though next time I think I’ll go longer.

This is one my favorite vegan brownie recipes! I used a GF flour blend instead of oat flour and 1/2 cup of maple syrup instead of the full 2/3 cup since we ran out. They were fudgy with a hint of cake texture. I also topped with chopped dark chocolate and almonds (we were out of pecans/walnuts). Your recipes never fail to impress!

We’ve been gluten free for many years and vegan for 18 months. The entire time we’ve searched for a brownie recipe that also met my food restrictions (no soy or cashews, etc.). My husband has longed for a decent brownie during that time. We’ve tried so many things, and always been a bit disappointed until we tried this recipe. Thank you so much for such a rich, delicious brownie. We are so pleased that we think we can share this with our family members who are not GF/V and they will love it too. I love the healthy ingredients, too! Thank you.

I made these the other night. I did not have almond butter so I subbed for sunflower butter and omitted the vanilla, they are sweet enough with all the maple syrup. I found these needed longer than 30 mins in the oven but that could just be my oven. Ended up baking for almost 45m minutes.

These are delish and kid approved! I have made them twice – the first time I reduced the sugar and only used 1/2 cup maple syrup because I knew I would be adding chocolate chips. They were still delish but better the second time when I made the recipe as written (go figure, lol!). They were not too sweet even with the full amount of syrup and chocolate chips. I find they keep and taste best when kept in the fridge because they are super fudgy. My kids and I both liked them best cool straight from the fridge. Delicious recipe I’ll be making again in the future!

I tried one with dates but it wasn’t nearly as good. I’d suggest sweetening with stevia, and compensating for the drier texture with more dairy-free milk and/or oil. Let us know it how it goes!

The brownies are delicious, thank you for this creative recipe! The only substitution I made was olive oil in place of avocado, since it was on hand. They are pretty dense and are now in the fridge – I hope I can wait until tomorrow to see how the taste changes overnight.

That quickly is usually in a pressure cooker, or if they’re sliced and steamed on the stovetop (steamer basket over water in a large pot + lid) it can take anywhere from 10-20.

I think you’re asking about the post-bake, pre-peel 5 minute steaming, right?  I did it on the cookie sheet I’d just taken out of the oven (folded the parchment paper over the potatoes), and they were perfectly easy to peel after 5 min as advertised!
These brownies were so amazingly yummy. I made 1.5x the recipe in a 9×13 pan, with 1/2 c. maple syrup and 1c. cocoa powder, and all the other ingredients at 1.5x the recipe quantities. So chocolatey and easily sweet enough with the decreased syrup.
Thanks Dana for this and so many other recipes that have become staples for my family. I’ve recommended your blog to many friends and relatives!

I hate to be one of those people who sees a recipe and immediately comments with a question about substitutions (sorry!) but if, theoretically speaking, a certain cook had some 100% pumpkin puree sitting in the fridge that needs to be used, would that be likely to work well in place of the sweet potato puree?

I made this brownie recipe with my chocoholic toddler son and husband in mind. I’m not a huge chocolate fan and the final result was tasty but overall too intensely chocolate for me and a bit bitter. I could taste the sweet potato (Barely) but not the almond butter (I used Barney butter)  in the finished product. 
I had less maple syrup than I thought so I had to use some honey (since honey is sweeter I used about 25 percent less, and since it is thicker than maple syrup, I zapped it in the microwave first to get it similarly liquidy so it wouldn’t throw the texture off). I was out of oat flour so I had to make my own in the food processor which resulted in a slightly coarser grain than commercial oat flour but didn’t seem to skew the smooth texture of the finished product. 
I doubled the recipe and used one 6 x 8 dish (32 minutes, center still a little gooey) and one 8 x 10 dish (40 minutes, haven’t cut into this batch yet). I found that I needed about two medium sweet potatoes to equal a full cup of purée, and since I only had two to start I had to cook another two in the microwave. 
I really like the texture of the brownies and my son seemed to enjoy them. They are indeed rich and fudgy and Have a very concentrated chocolate Flavor. 
I love Minimalist Baker and have made the banana bread, chocolate zucchini bread, pumpkin bread, and carrot cake over and over again. Thanks for putting gluten free, dairy free, vegan recipes out there!

Hi Dana! Do you have a sub for oat flour? Thanks!

We also tested almond and coconut flour, but didn’t like them quite as much. I’d say one of those or a GF blend for semi-similar results!

Hi! I can’t have oats. Would it work with almond flour or any other flour? Thanks :)
