Spirit, sugar, citrus—the original big three—come together in the Whiskey Sour, whose history stretches back to the Lincoln administration. Few drinks in the cocktail canon are as quick to satisfy and endlessly mutable as the Whiskey Sour. Add a flourish to any component, and you have your own personal spin on the classic. We like our Whiskey Sour thickened with egg white and a few dashes of aromatic bitters for a complementary spice note.






































































Ingredients



2 oz Bourbon


3/4 oz Fresh lemon juice


1/2 oz Simple syrup


1/2 oz Egg white (optional)


Garnish: Angostura bitters








Steps





Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake.





Strain into a coupe.





Garnish with 3 dashes of Angostura bitters.
