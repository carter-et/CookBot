Easy Chinese Chicken Salad (GF/Soy-Free)



A friend recently requested a recipe for Chinese Chicken Salad on the blog. The rest is history. Plus, look at those colors and that crunch!
Introducing our fresh and flavorful 30-minute Chinese Chicken Salad made with seriously simple ingredients.



How to Make Chinese Chicken Salad
Cabbage – we went with a mix of napa and red cabbage. Napa cabbage for a more classic touch and red cabbage for a pop of color and nice crunch.Carrots – bring on the crunch and color (Hello, antioxidants)!Green onion – perfect for raw dishes, green onion adds subtle onion flavor that enhances the salad.Chicken – we boiled and shredded chicken breasts to make this salad protein-packed and filling. If vegan, feel free to omit the chicken and enjoy this as a side dish instead of a main, or sub our Miso-Glazed Chickpeas!Nuts/seeds – we went with toasted almonds and sesame seeds for a bit of crunch and extra sesame flavor.Dressing – we opted for a sesame-ginger dressing made with simple ingredients.

Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing
The simple, soy-free dressing is made with coconut aminos, which provide saltiness and umami flavor. We also tested it with tamari, but found the flavor to be overpowering. However, if you want to sub tamari, try starting with half as much as it’s quite a bit saltier. 
Rice vinegar adds a little tang, and toasted sesame oil provides that classic Chinese Chicken Salad flavor. Maple syrup adds sweetness and ginger and garlic add a little zing.

Simply pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. That’s it!
What to Serve with Chinese Chicken Salad
This salad is delicious on its own, but for a more filling meal, it would pair well with our Easy Vegan Fried Rice, Crispy Shallot Spring Rolls, Easy Tofu Pad Thai, or Vegan Singapore Noodles.
It would also be a great dish for meal prep! If making in advance, add the dressing just prior to serving to keep the vegetables crunchy.

We hope you LOVE this salad! It’s:CrunchyFlavorfulFreshColorful& So delicious!

					Entrée or Side				


Cuisine:

					Asian-Inspired, Gluten-Free				


Freezer Friendly

					No				


Does it keep?

					3-4 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
SALAD


2
small to medium
chicken breasts, shredded 
(~2 ½ cups shredded chicken as recipe is written // see notes for vegan options)


3
cups
thinly sliced napa cabbage


2
cups
thinly sliced red cabbage


1
large
carrot, shredded


1
bundle
green onions, thinly sliced on an angle




DRESSING


5
Tbsp
coconut aminos 
(or sub tamari, but start with 1/2 the amount as it’s saltier)


3
Tbsp
rice vinegar


2 ½
Tbsp
toasted sesame oil


1 ½
Tbsp
maple syrup


1
Tbsp
fresh grated ginger 
(mince instead of grating for less pungent taste)


4
cloves
garlic, minced




FOR SERVING


2
Tbsp
sesame seeds, slightly toasted


1/4
cup
slivered almonds, slightly toasted


1
healthy pinch
each sea salt and black pepper 
(plus more to taste)


Chili garlic sauce
(optional)





Instructions



Start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Then add chicken, slightly reduce heat to medium-high, cover, and cook until done all the way through — about 10 minutes. Then remove and use two forks to shred. Set aside.


In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding coconut aminos, rice vinegar, sesame oil, maple syrup, fresh ginger, and garlic to a jar (or mixing bowl) and shaking vigorously (or whisking) to combine.


Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more ginger for zing, garlic for kick, maple syrup for sweetness, sesame oil for more prominent toasted sesame flavor, or coconut aminos for more saltiness. Set aside.


Shred your napa cabbage, red cabbage, and carrot, slice the green onions, and add to a large serving dish or bowl. Toss to combine.


Next add sesame seeds and almonds to a small pan and toast over medium heat for ~5 minutes until just slightly golden brown, stirring frequently. Be careful not to burn. Set aside to cool.


Add shredded chicken breast to salad, along with toasted sesame seeds and almonds. Top with dressing and toss to combine. Season with a bit of salt and pepper for more flavor. Sample salad and add more salt and/or pepper to taste or more coconut aminos for depth of flavor.


Serve immediately or store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. Not freezer friendly.

This is a quick and fabulous (and affordable) recipe  with or without meat.  I cheat by using prepackaged shredded  cabbage.   Good with both coconut aminos or tamari.  I do cut down a bit on the green onion.  Something different to take to a party. Thank you, once again, Minimalist Baker for another great recipe to add variety to my life.

This was so easy and delicious! I kept the salad and the dressing separate, which kept the salad crispy. It was so nice to have a healthy, delicious lunch everyday! I used soy sauce instead of the aminos, which was definitely my mistake. I’ll be using the coconut aminos in the future!

I made this last night! I made the chicken for my husband, but for me, I subbed portabella mushrooms. It was ridiculously delicious. Your recipes are making clean eating the opposite of torturous ?

Delicious! We had it twice this past week, both with the miso paste coated garbanzos and pulled chicken.  I used honey instead of maple syrup in the dressing and added red pepper and avocado to the salad!  I will definitely make this recipe again!
thank you

Love this ❤️ About a year ago I switched from being plant-based, to incorporating meat and dairy slowly. I’m in college, and need quick recipes, that still have a good balance of protein and veg! This is perfect and fresh- thank you!!

I saw this in my email today and knew I needed to make it tonight because I had all the ingredients. The only thing I did differently was use packaged coleslaw mix and I also added a few Craisins. Because I used leftover chicken it was a really quick and easy meal. I love it! So good. Will definitely make again.

Customizable and super tasty! I wanted to make this for lunch today and didn’t have time to run to the store, so I used what I had on hand, subbing shredded kale plus other veggies for the cabbage. I just quick chopped a carrot, couple stalks celery, some broccoli, half a small yellow onion, and pulsed them a few times in my food processor until they were uniform, before adding to the kale. I also used boneless chicken thighs that I cooked up in the instant pot instead of breasts. I subbed in 1 T of tamari for some of the coconut aminos because I tend to like things saltier! And I added a squeeze of sriracha as well. I was too lazy to toast the almonds and sesame seeds. It came out GREAT! Super satisfying with a nice crunchiness. Loved the almonds in there. This one is definitely going into regular rotation.

Hiya
Can you clarify if this is 8 portions as a side and if so how many for a main? It’s only 2 chicken breast so I was wondering. 
Thanks!

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
January 29, 2020 at 12:04 pm 

I’d say 3-4 for a main (depending on how hungry everyone is), or 6-8 for a side.

Excellent recipe, the dressing is a nice blend of salty and sweet Asian flavor and definitely don’t skip the toasted almonds and sesame seeds, so yummy! I veganized it by adding sautéed tempeh. Great recipe, Dana! Thanks for sharing and looking forward to the app!
