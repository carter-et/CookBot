I believe different types of dishes have the power to change how people feel.  When it’s hot and sunny outside, the cool crisp salad tastes extra refreshing.  Personally, whenever the weather is cold and raining I always crave some comfort food.  This easy to prepare cream penne pasta will quickly warm you up.  It’s easy and simple but it tastes goooood!  My kids had seconds or thirds and they both said “Hmmmm it’s yummy!!”  I hope you will try this recipe this winter.

Ingredients



4
servings
penne pasta


4
Tbsp
unsalted butter
(4 Tbsp = ¼ cup)


1
Onion
(minced)


4
slices
bacons
(cut into ½" pieces)


5
Tbsp
all-purpose flour


2
cups
milk


½
lb
napa cabbage
(½ lb = about ½ small napa cabbage) (cut into ½" pieces)


4
mushrooms
(sliced)


1
cube
vegetable bouillon


1
cup
cheddar cheese
(shredded or freshly grated)


½
tsp
sea salt


Freshly ground black pepper


¼
cup
panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)


Parsley
(fresh, finely chopped)





Instructions



Cook penne al dente according to package instructions.


Meanwhile in a large skillet (I use Le Creuset cast iron braiser), heat butter on medium heat. Add onion and bacon and sauté until onion gets soft.


Sprinkle flour evenly. Using a wooden spoon, mix well with ingredients quickly.


Slowly add milk (3-4 Tbsp. at a time). Mix well while scraping off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon.


Add napa cabbage, mushrooms, bouillon cube, salt, and pepper, and sauté until they are soft.


Add cooked penne and mix all together.


Add ½ cup cheddar cheese and mix well. Here, if your skillet is not oven safe, move the mixture into a baking pan.


Sprinkle the rest of cheese on top and then sprinkle Panko evenly on top.


Broil in the oven until the top gets nicely browned. Sprinkle fresh parsley on top and put it back in the oven for 1 minute.
