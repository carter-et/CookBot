Smoky BBQ Black Bean Burger

Say hello to your new favorite veggie burger.
It’s gluten-free, BIG on flavor, infused with smoky BBQ flavor, and perfect on the grill or stovetop. Let’s do this!

This burger is easy to make, requiring simple methods and 10 wholesome ingredients you likely have on hand right now.
It all starts with black beans that are cooked down until dry and cracked, which helps keep the burgers from being mushy. Then comes toasted pecans, which are pulsed into a meal.


Then we add quinoa, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, cumin, chili powder, BBQ sauce, and salt. Quinoa adds moisture and also binds the burgers, and the rest is all about flavor: sweet potatoes for sweetness, mushrooms for “meatiness” and texture, and the spices and sauce for smoky BBQ flavor.

For these burgers, it’s best to sear both sides on the stovetop and then finish baking in the oven, where they will dry out and firm up a bit. But they are firm enough for the grill as well!
Once cooked, it’s all about the toppings. We went for vegan buns, lettuce, cabbage, red pepper, pickles, and more BBQ + a little hot sauce. Swoon.

We hope you all LOVE these burgers! They’re:
Smoky
Tender
Hearty
Satisfying
Customizable
Easy to make
& SO delicious
These burgers would make the perfect weeknight meal for you and the family or for hosting! Serve with Crispy Baked Fries, Garlicky Kale Salad, or Garlicky Guac and Plantain Chips!

(and gluten-free if needed)


Veggies of choice 
(i.e. onion, cabbage, tomato, pickles)





Instructions



If you haven’t yet, cook quinoa and set aside to cool (see notes for instructions).


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and spread rinsed, dried black beans onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake beans for 6 minutes. Then add pecans to the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes more. The nuts should be fragrant and golden brown (be careful not to burn), and the beans should appear dry and cracked open (this way, they do not become mushy in the burger mix). Set aside to cool. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 C).


In the meantime, heat a medium to large cast-iron or metal skillet over medium/medium-low heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and the sweet potato. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes, turning heat down if the potatoes are browning too quickly. Once browned on the underside, flip and cook for 3-4 minutes more or until tender and golden brown. Remove from the pan.


To the still-hot pan, add the sliced mushrooms and coconut aminos (optional - sub a little salt otherwise) and cook on medium/medium-high for about 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, or until they’re browned, fragrant, and cooked down to half their size. Set aside.


To a food processor, add beans and pecans and blitz/pulse into a loose meal (some texture is good - you don’t want a powder).


Next, add cooked sweet potato, mushrooms, half the quinoa, sea salt, chili powder, cumin, and BBQ sauce and pulse a few times to combine (again, some texture is good here - you're not going for a purée).


Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and stir in the rest of the quinoa. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cumin for smokiness, chili powder for heat, BBQ sauce for sweetness / depth of flavor, or salt for saltiness.


If the mixture appears too wet, add more quinoa. If it looks too dry, add more BBQ sauce (or a little coconut aminos) to moisten.


Divide the mixture into four even balls and form into patties with your hands or by lining a 1/2 cup measuring cup with plastic wrap, packing the mixture inside, then lifting the plastic wrap out - mash slightly into more of a disc. Refrigerate burgers for 30 minutes.


Once chilled, heat the cast-iron or metal pan from earlier over medium heat. Once hot, add a bit more oil (or water) and the burgers. Cook for 4-5 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook for 4-5 minutes on the other side. Then turn off heat, glaze/brush with a bit more BBQ sauce, and transfer the pan to the oven. Bake at 375 F (190C) for 10-15 minutes more. The burgers should appear browned.


Serve as is or with toppings. We enjoyed ours on buns with butter lettuce, shredded red pepper, shredded cabbage, pickles, radish, and more BBQ sauce. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month.






 

Notes
*To cook quinoa, add 1 part rinsed, drained quinoa to a small saucepan and toast for 3 minutes over medium heat. Then add 2 parts water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 18 minutes or until water is absorbed. Then fluff with a fork and set off the heat uncovered to cool. (As the recipe is written, the amounts should be 1/2 cup quinoa to 1 cup water.)*Prep time does not include cooking and cooling quinoa.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate for 1 burger calculated with oil and without coconut aminos or toppings.

I made this recipe and loved it. I’d like to make it again, but I only have 3 oz mushrooms. Can I substitute zucchini, or is it too watery?

Mix a bit more (the quinoa and beans) and add a date or two when blending (to help bind). You can also try adding more BBQ sauce if they appear crumbly.

I didn’t have any issues with the burger not sticking together – we ended up not using mushrooms and left the pre made patties in the fridge for 24 hours so idk if that made a difference. Definitely my new favorite go to.

Been wanting to try this recipe for ages but didnt have the right ingredients so I subbed rice for quinoa, walnuts for pecans, soy sauce for coconut aminos and ommited the salt. They were still absolutely delicious! My husband has only just started eating a plant based diet so any recipe that gets his approval is staying! The 2 1/2 tsp chili powder did make for a fiery burger but we really enjoyed it!
I made them up the night before, cooked them for lunch the following day and they were great. Nice to know I can pre prep for bbqs or quick meals. Perfect ?

Everything was amazing! We don’t usually have pecans on hand so I just use whatever nut we have so I’ve used almonds and cashews, still turned out amazing! We have also made a bunch and instead of cooking them right away froze them and they were still amazing when we ate them later, just fried and cooked as the reciepe indicates. They are so delicious and definitely added to the weekly meal plans!

This was an awesome recipe! I added 1/2 quinoa and 1/2 brown rice. I omitted the salt, as I’m watching my sodium intake, and didn’t miss it! The texture was amazing! I kept some pieces of the beans and nuts intact, which allowed the burger to have some nice crunchiness throughout. I was pleasantly surprised by how firm the patty was without being dry. Baking the black beans was a genius move! I thought the recipe called for too much of the cumin and the chili powder, but I was wrong – the seasoning along with the BBQ sauce added so much flavor. Thank you for a tremendous recipe! I look forward to trying your other veggie burger recipes soon.

Hi there, love the recipes. Just a quick question regarding the nutritional info as I am into my fitness and bodybuilding. I was thinking 289 calories seems a little low with the listed macronutrients of 19g fat, 46g carb and 12g protein. Using these macros, the calorie count comes to 403. There is perhaps something I don’t know regarding nutrition. Any help on this? Thank you :)

February 5, 2019 at 9:24 am 

Thanks for the reply but that is an article about calorie counting and I’m not sure if you understood my original comment. For this recipe, the macronutrients don’t add up to the calories. So either the calories or the macros are wrong. It’s not a huge deal because I track them myself but I do use them as a guideline as to what the ratios for your recipes are. I know I’m probably in the small minority of readers who care about this stuff but, as the article you linked states, it is important to look at the nutritional info of the food you are eating.

Superb! My favorite part is that it doesn’t fall apart like 100 other veggie burger recipes i’ve tried. Flavors are fantastic. I will definitely be making this again as my go-to veggie burger. My one and only complaint is the amount of time involved — it literally took up my whole evening to make this.  But it was well worth it. I’m happy I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Yes, yes, yes to your comments that they do not fall apart and have great flavor! I cooked the potatoes (steamed chunks)  and rice (used some in other dishes) a couple of days ago, so these came together pretty quickly. I can imagine doing all the steps in one evening took your whole night!

Just finished making these! Haven’t tasted yet (lol) but they look awesome. I don’t have a food processor so I used my blender… if using a blender, I recommend blending beans + pecans/sweet potatoes + mushrooms and putting them in a separate bowl and then combinging together. It will help avoid the beans and pecans from becoming a purée while the potatoes stay whole. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Wonderful flavor.  Made a double batch a few weeks ago for vegan family who LOVED them.  Also a huge hit with the non vegans!
There are quite a few steps and it seemed to take me longer than I usually like to spend cooking a meal.  So about to repeat for tomorrow so I’m pre cooking quinoa, drying beans and cooking sweet potatoes and mushrooms a day ahead as I’m serving left overs tonight!  Hoping that splitting across two nights will make it seem less burdensome.

These were excellent!  Loved the flavor and consistency.  Made a double batch and was able to get 10 burgers out of it.   Does require several steps but so worth it.  Unlike many other veggie burgers I’ve tried I had no issue with them falling apart.  I really think getting those beans super dry is the reason — so smart!     So we made 2 as directed and I’ve now frozen 8 pre frying/baking.   I’m serving them on Friday at my bday BBQ dinner.  I’ve read all the comments and still a bit confused as to the best strategy for cooking them out of the freezer — if it’s bake for 10 min then fry, for 8-10 min when does the BBQ sauce on top make an appearance.  Thanks so much!  Can’t wait to serve to my omni friends, along with your macaroni salad. :-)

Last night I made this for me and my partner. We subbed extra black beans because he doesn’t like quinoa. I didn’t have any vegan bbq sauce, so I just used the Hunts or whatever it was in my fridge. The burgers were a perfect consistency after briefly frying in a pan and then baking. We had them on potato rolls with tomato, onion, cheese, and pickles. My predominately carnivorous partner said he would totally eat them again. Good amount of prep work and dishes involved, but a fun date night in.

These burgers are the bomb!  I made them true to the recipe and it was very satisfying.  However next time I wanted to serve them on a bed of lettuce and thought to omit the BBQ sauce and use liquid smoke instead. Check!  Also for the dressing I processed avocado, jalapeno, lime juice and cilantro in the cuisinart.   This worked well on the burger and as a dressing for the salad which included raw veggie sticks and more of the roasted pecans.  Love this and so did the guests!  Thank you so much Dana for the great recipes!!  XOXO

Delicious! So this is the most time consuming recipe I prepared for a while but it is worth it. I didn’t have any pecans so I used a mix between walnuts and sunflower seeds. Since I made this for the whole family (including a 3 and a 1-y-o) I used less BBQ sauce and added a bit of homemade ketchup instead and omitted the chili powder. My 3-y-o daughter was happy to help – she loves pushing the buttons of the food processor and making the patties. I cooked them only in the pan and they held together beautifully. Enough so that my 1-y-o son did not smash his patty. Since it does take a fair while I made double the amount so we can eat them again later on in the week.

I am an omnivore, but I often make plant based meals for my family to diversify our paletes. This was absolutely the best black bean burger I’ve ever made. The texture and flavor is just great. All 5 of my omni crew happily tucked in these burgers. I will definitely make these again.
I have seen comments about the mushrooms. If you don’t leave any visible chunks, or let a mushroom hater watch you add them in, I really don’t think the mushrooms will be noticeable. I have two mushroom haters in my crew and they didn’t bat an eye.

We have made many of your recipes over the past several years, but never left any comments. This recipe was SO good, i just had to let you know! As a Midwestern carnivore married to a vegan, this was my first attempt at making a veggie burger at home. We chose your recipe because the ingredients sounded so delicious and simple…and they were! These burgers turned out better than most veggie burgers I’ve tried (and loved) in restaurants.  The flavor and texture were PERFECT, so the long prep time was totally worth it. We followed your suggestion to use hemp seeds in place of pecans to make this recipe nut-free. I was impressed at how well the burgers held together and how crispy they were on the outside after baking. So glad we made a double batch!

A lil update on my above comment. I did freeze half the recipe when I made these after the refrigeration step. Once I thawed them, I panned fried them and put them in the oven like the recipe says. They were definitely more dry and crumbled apart a lil in the pan when frying. They were still good, but a lil to dry for my liking. Definitely best eaten right fresh.

These burgers tasted great, but never firmed  up. I don’t own a metal pan, so I water “fried” them in a ceramic coated skillet then baked them on a foil-lined baking sheet. Could that have affected the texture? Also, the patties were in the fridge for a few days before I actually cooked them. I don’t know if that had any impact. I’ll have to try again, making them thinner in the hopes that they’ll dry out more.

I made these burgers tonight but they turned out super mushy! I was disappointed but it may have been my own mistake. The recipe also made 9 huge patties somehow. I cooked the beans just as you instructed. They were super dry but I steamed the yam. They were still al dente when I threw them in the food processor but could that have caused the mush? I guess I should’ve thrown in another dry ingredient but I was too hungry to play with the recipe so I baked them for a really long time to dry them out as much as possible. I’m gluten free and the buns I used were a bit stiff so with every bite the patty just squished out everywhere :( The flavour was delicious and I’ve made a lot of your recipes and they are fantastic. I’m convinced I did something wrong. I’ll definitely have to make this again but I’ll most likely crumble the remaining patties and use them as taco filling. I’m going to try the vanilla cake tomorrow :)

WOW!  I have to say that I have never posted a comment before but these were so good, I had to.
I substituted cashews for the pecans due to my sons allergy to pecans.  I used Braggs liquid aminos instead of the coconut aminos (thats what I had in).  I also cut back a little on the chili powder and cumin. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. They are moist (but not too), very flavorful and satisfying.  I used the pressing in the half cup method for shaping and it made 7 good sized patties.
I will definitely be making these again.

I am going to make this recipe for my adult kids and grandkids, who are not vegan.  The recipe really sounds great.  I am trying it out today, then will make a double or triple batch for the “kids”.  My question is:  When you list “sweet potato”, do you mean an actual sweet potato or a yam?

Thank you for your fast reply! Yes it was a perfect ‘loose meal’. It all formed a cohesive ball when I removed it from the food processor. That’s what doesn’t make sense. It adhered and formed patties. I noticed that after cooking it was still soft and sticky in the middle as well. Fried first in the pan, then 15 mins at 375.

Hi Amy! It’s best to sear both sides on the stovetop and then finish baking in the oven, where they will dry out and firm up a bit, but if you try cutting down steps, just know that they may not be as firm. As for freezing them, I recommend freezing prior to frying, and then when ready to use, bake them to thaw, followed by frying. Hope this helps!

This was absolutely delicious. We had this yesterday with red cabbage and caramelized balsamic red onions. I wonder though, if I could do something about the crumbly texture. While raw, the consistency was really dough-like and easy to press into patties, but after baking it it held its form but crumbled quite a lot while eating.  Maybe my patties were too thin? They were about the size and thickness of the palm of my hand. I will absolutely make this again, thank you so much for sharing !

Great looking recipe.  I’m on the hunt for a burger of this consistency that utilizes charbroiled flavor in lieu of tex-mex spices. I suspect swapping the black beans for one of more nuetral flavor, and perhaps swapping charcoals for the cumin might work. Suggestions? =^..^=

Hmmm, when I saw this in my mailing list,  I was a bit skeptical. I am pretty set on the Beyond Meat burger and my Boca vegan patties, but I definitely think that this homemade recipe made with black beans, quinoa, and SWEET POTATO (OMG!!) will become a new favorite of mine! Barbecue-flavored anything wins me over too. I might be daring one day and swap out the barbecue for teriyaki, a soyaki sauce, or even a Sriracha peanut sauce for some Asian flairs!

Hi Dana,
I’ve tried the bake-beans-before-burgers trick and it’s fantastic! Who likes mushy burgers? Not me! I am a bit lazy sometimes though, and the process of soaking beans, cooking beans, then baking them is a lot of steps. I just tried a burger recipe treating the beans the way I do falafel, and I can’t figure out why I didn’t do it before: don’t cook the soaked beans, just rinse after soaking and throw in the processor! The beans turn into the same texture as pulsed nuts and cook wonderfully in the burger. Less steps :)
Cheers,
Katie
*Of course, this hack is for if you use dried beans. Canned beans and baking is definitely the way to go!

That’s a very excellent point! I’ve used sprouted chickpeas in the past, but in all honesty they were sprouted only because I forgot I was soaking them. I think next round I’ll do a blind trial: one with cooked + baked beans, one with just soaked beans, and one with soaked + sprouted beans to see if I notice any difference or like one over the other. :)

Hi Dana – Love your stuff !
Just curious if anyway you could make a low protein veggie  burger recipe for a PKU kid?   Most of your vegan stuff has a high protein bean or nut which I fiddle with and take out or substitute but as you spend way more time in the creation phase than I do, I was just wondering if you could think up a low protein burger mix … as summer is coming here in Ohio !!!

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
March 21, 2018 at 10:38 am 

Hi Chris! These ones aren’t too high protein. But to make this lower protein, sub the quinoa for brown or white rice, increase the amount of grain you add, and cut the beans back. Hope that helps!

My boyfriend made these last night, using raw walnuts instead of the pecans. You should have seen the pride on his face when he took the first bite. I would be careful to process them for long enough though, since ours fell apart quite a bit. Flavour was great. Will definitely be making these again.

Just made this tonight and they were fantastic!  I followed the recipe with no substitutions.  The prep work does take some time but the burgers were worth it.  Due to my schedule that day, I did have to stick the burgers in the fridge after I pan fried them and before i put them in the oven with the barbecue sauce.  I just baked them a tad bit longer to make sure they were hot and browned.  Served them on thin buns with avocado, slaw, onion, pickle, lettuce, and red bell pepper slices.  So good!

Hi Joanne! I am wondering if you could have cooked the beans down a bit longer to dry them out and prevent the burgers from having a mushy consistency. The beans should have appeared dry and cracked open. Glad you enjoyed the recipe though!

I love your website and have made so many of the recipes, so thanks for everything you do. I had the same problem, and read the comments before making the burgers, so I made sure my black beans were super dried out before making the burgers, but they still turned out a little bit mushy (and delicious). Do you have any suggestions for making crispier burgers? Also would these burgers still be good if I made a bunch in advance and froze them? If so, would that change the cooking time at all? Thanks again!

Support @ Minimalist Baker says 
April 3, 2018 at 9:13 am 

While they are still soft inside, you could try making them thinner to cook them through more which may make them crispier? If you are hoping to make a bunch ahead, you can store them in the freezer up to 1 month.

These are absolutely delicious, better than most any veg burger you can get in a restaurant. The smoke flavor really makes it. My whole family loved them! Easy to prepare, though mine made six patties instead of four as in the recipe. Not complaining though! Another plus is that they don’t fall apart; perfect firmness and texture. Definitely a keeper.

One of the best home made BBQ sauces I’ve had in 45 years of being a be vegetarian is, with some modifications, the one in the 40 + year old:  THE FARM COOKBOOK, the BBQ sauce for Gluten ribs.  I use much less sweet, salt,  oil and mustard.  It is not hard to make, but does require a full hour of simmer time, which makes all the flavors transform and wonderful.  Check it out.  All in one big cast Iron pan.  Awesome!  Ann

Super easy to make your own BBQ sauce… This recipe from Isa is a go to for me. I make a extra, and place it in tiny tupperwares in the freezer.
For the BBQ Sauce:
1/2 cup vegetable broth
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tablespoon soy sauce (I sub coconut aminos)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon prepared mustard (I use Dijon)
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke
1/2 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce
