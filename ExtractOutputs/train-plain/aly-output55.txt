Easy Masala Chai Recipe



Behold, a seriously dreamy cup of chai. It’s creamy, dairy-free, naturally sweetened, caffeine optional, and perfectly spiced.
We already have recipes on the blog for Caffeine-Free Chai Mix and a Vegan Chai Latte. But as we’ve played around more with customizing the spices and perfecting the flavor, we came up with this version, which uses fresh ginger and whole spices. 
We must say, this is our perfect cup of chai. Swoon! Let us show you how easy and totally not intimidating this recipe is.



This masala chai recipe is the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. And it comes together in just 25 minutes with 8 ingredients in 1 pot. 

What is Masala Chai?
Masala chai is a creamy, spiced tea that’s most popular in India but is increasingly enjoyed around the world. The primary difference between chai and masala chai is that masala chai includes spices, while chai is simply tea and milk.
Chai is typically made with four components:
Black tea (we prefer bagged or loose-leaf, decaf when possible)Milk (we went dairy-free with coconut and/or cashew )Sweetener (we went for a little maple syrup)Spices (ginger, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, black pepper)
The spices vary depending on the recipe, but our favorite combination is cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, and ginger.

How to Make Chai Tea
Our inspired version begins by lightly crushing the spices in a mortar and pestle (or a cutting board and heavy pan will do!). 
Slightly crushing the spices opens them up more and makes for a stronger infusion (so you get more flavor out of a lesser amount), packing more of a punch with fewer ingredients and less cost.
The crushed spices are added to a saucepan with water and freshly grated ginger and left to simmer for about 15 minutes. Grating the ginger makes for a stronger ginger flavor. But if gingery chai isn’t your thing, slice instead of grating and/or slightly reduce the amount. 
We prefer steeping first in water alone because we find it makes a stronger infusion than adding the milk too soon.
The black tea and dairy-free milk are then added and heated slightly. For a full-bodied drink, we like using thick, rich dairy-free milks such as our Cashew Coconut Oat Milk.

Then all that’s left is to add your sweetener of choice and strain.
It’s the perfect drink to enjoy cuddled up with a blanket and a good book. Or make a big batch and reheat on the stovetop or in a milk frother on busier days.
We hope you LOVE this chai! It’s:SpicyWarmingCaffeine optionalComfortingNaturally sweetened& Simple to make

Easy Masala Chai Recipe

A delicious and easy dairy-free chai recipe made with whole spices. It's spicy, comforting, naturally sweetened, and made in just 1 pot with 8 ingredients! 


Author: Minimalist Baker





Prep Time 5 minutes 

Cook Time 20 minutes 

Total Time 25 minutes 



Servings: 3 (Cups)


Category:

					Beverage				


Cuisine:

					Dairy-Free, Vegan				


Freezer Friendly

					No				


Does it keep?

					3-4 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


1
whole
cinnamon stick


6-8
green
cardamom pods


1
tsp
whole black peppercorns


3-4
whole
cloves


2 ½
cups
water


2
Tbsp
grated ginger 
(for less intense ginger flavor, slice instead of grating)


3
Tbsp
loose leaf black tea 
(or ~3-4 black tea bags // use decaf as needed)


2
cups
dairy-free milk 
(we favor oat milk, coconut milk, and cashew milk // use thicker, richer dairy-free milks like canned coconut milk or our Oatly recipe for creamier chai!)


Sweetener such as stevia, organic cane sugar, or maple syrup to taste





Instructions



Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, peppercorns, and cloves to the bowl of a mortar (or cutting board) and use pestle (or heavy pan) to slightly crush the spices. You aren’t pulverizing into a powder, just slightly crushing into small pieces (see photo).


To a medium saucepan add crushed spices, water, and grated (or sliced) ginger and bring to a boil over high heat. (Note: For a less gingery chai, reduce amount of ginger and slice rather than grating). Then reduce heat slightly to medium/medium-low and maintain a simmer for 15 minutes or until it reduces by about one-third.


Add tea (loose leaf or bags) and dairy-free milk of choice (we love light canned coconut) and lower heat to low. Cover and continue cooking for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Then turn off heat and let steep for 5 minutes more (covered) or longer for deeper flavor.


Add sweetener of choice to taste (we prefer stevia or maple syrup, but sugar is more traditional). Strain through a fine mesh strainer before serving.


Keep strained, cooled leftovers covered in the fridge up to 3-4 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in a milk frother. Not freezer friendly.

I made this as the recipe states, with a little extra cardamom, maple syrup, and coconut milk… it is quite possibly the best damn thing I have ever tasted. Seriously, it is sooooo good. Thanks so much for this and all your vegetarian recipes – I love them all!!!

This is mind-boggling tasty! I made it without black tea and instead added a bit more of each whole spice + extra grated ginger so that it was a concentrate of sorts. Then I’d foam a good amount of oat milk – and voila. Masala chai latte, sans caffeine. I’m hooked and about to make my second batch now. Sidenote – it’s sweet enough for me without adding any sweetener, but maybe it’s the natural sweetness of the foamed oat milk that does it for me.
Thank you so much!! This is my first rating and comment though I’ve made a ton of your recipes and loved them ALL. I solemnly swear to review more!

Absolutely loved this and have been making it non-stop! It is creamy and perfectly spiced. I used store-bought oatmilk and it was still great, but hope to try to homemade some time as well.

Thanks for the recipe! I have a question. I LOVE chai, but due to kidney stone issues, I cannot have black tea any more.  Do you have any suggestions for substitutes?

Rooibos! Or omit – it’s delicious with just the spices in my opinion.

This was sooo easy and delicious! I made a few tweaks (more cinnamon no ginger) and actually just put the spices in a tea strainer and cooked in my electric tea pot before adding the tea milk and cane sugar. Soooo easy! Like easy enough to make while rushing to get ready for work. 
Definitely worth a try!

Would this recipe also work for an iced chai? I so, would you change anything or simply drink once chilled in the fridge? This looks so good and I want to try and make it…but I am a wimp with hot drinks.

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

I wouldn’t change anything! Other than you don’t really need to add the dairy-free milk to the pot. You could add it to your drink upon serving. Let us know how it goes!

It definitely works for an iced chai! I would just recommend increasing the water a little bit since you don’t add the milk with the tea. I also added some vanilla and it was AMAZING! Never going back to store bought chai-thanks!!

This recipe sounds wonderful and as usual, the photos are gorgeous!
I wonder if I could add in some helpful herbs like lemon balm or nettle? I’d imagine that they wouldn’t affect the test much and would create an extra powerful drink to enjoy!

I think so! It will, of course, alter the flavor. Let us know if you try it!

Just wanted to come back to rate! Giving four stars because I think there are things I will tweak next time to taste more tea (steep before adding milk) and more balance of the spices (less ginger, more cardamom and cloves). It’s a really nice recipe, though, and I’ve loved being able to pull it out of the fridge and reheat a portion in the mornings.

Loved the recipe. I used rice milk (which I usually use for tea) and jaggery for sweetener. I will try with almond milk soon. Also, adding a pinch of turmeric when heating the milk will be highly beneficial to health.

Found this recipe late and night and just had to try it!! Now I’m enjoying my lovely cup of tea at midnight. 
This is a really delicious recipe, it’s spicy but not too spicy (:  I used lactose free milk and sweetened it with raw sugar.

This is easy and delicious to prepare.
I used  high quality organic black tea bags and homemade organic cashew milk which are key to a great taste.
The leftovers today tasted even better as the flavors were intensified after a very slow reheat with an additional cinnamon stick topped w fresh organic mint.

Any loose leaf or bagged black tea will do. I avoid caffeine, so I used bagged decaf black tea :D

I made this with Califia Farms toasted coconut almondmilk blend. I was initially a bit disappointed by the somewhat bland (albeit spicy) flavor, but found that a little pinch of salt brought it all together. A very delicious and cozy beverage!

I’m so excited that you’re sharing a recipe for masala chai because it is such a staple in our household as I’ve grown up with chai. Since going dairy free, I’ve found it hard to recreate the richness that my mum’s has. I’m looking forward to trying this and will definitely add a review and rating. Have you tried adding some fresh mint when you add the ginger? It adds a little something special and tastes lovely :) Would love to know what you think of that if you try it out.

Can u grind the spices instead? Does the water make the milk feel dilute?

You can grind them, I just find it easier to steep and strain when they aren’t ground :D

I think this is a really respectful and informed take on masala chai, well done! I’ve never tried making it with plant based milk, I’ll give it a try. But I do prefer boiling the milk and the sugar, I find the sugar gains a certain “cooked” flavour, if that even makes sense… Beautifully filmed as always!
