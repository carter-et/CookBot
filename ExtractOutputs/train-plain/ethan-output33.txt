                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

These healthy braised greens are a flavorful side to add to your plate. If you prefer, instead of the croutons, you can add potatoes to the pan with the leeks, onions and fennel and cook for about 10 minutes before adding the greens. Source: EatingWell Magazine, March 2020

                                                ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil plus 2 tablespoons, divided, plus more for garnish
                                            








                                                2 large leeks, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced and rinsed well
                                            








                                                2 medium onions, coarsely chopped

                                                1 large fennel bulb, coarsely chopped, plus 2/3 cup chopped fennel fronds or fresh dill, divided
                                            








                                                2 teaspoons fennel seeds, crushed
                                            








                                                2 pounds mixed greens, such as spinach, sorrel and/or chard, stems trimmed and coarsely chopped
                                            








                                                ½ cup water
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon salt
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon ground pepper
                                            








                                                3 cups cubed whole-wheat bread
                                            








                                                ¼ cup lemon juice
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Heat 1/3 cup oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add leeks and cook, stirring, until soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onions, scallions, fennel bulb and fennel seeds; stir to coat with the oil. Add greens and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in water, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook until the greens are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. (If the sauce is too watery, cook for 2 to 4 minutes over high heat to reduce it.)

                                      Step 2
                                    



Meanwhile, position rack in upper third of oven; preheat broiler. Spread bread on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Broil, stirring once, until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Stir 1/3 cup fennel fronds (or dill) and lemon juice into the greens; cook for 2 minutes.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Serve topped with the remaining 1/3 cup fennel fronds (or dill), the croutons and more oil, if desired.
