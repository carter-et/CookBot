Lentil Mushroom Stew Over Mashed Potatoes

Friends, prepare yourselves for a hug in the form of a recipe.
Consider this your go-to dish when comfort food is on the brain. Not only is it hearty and satisfying, it’s also simple, requiring just 10 basic ingredients and 40 minutes to make (from start to finish). Let’s comfort food!

The base for this dish is a mushroom and lentil gravy/stew.
It starts with sautéed shallot and mushrooms seasoned with coconut aminos, salt, and pepper for rich, deep flavor. Then come lentils, thyme for aromatics, and vegetable broth. As that’s simmering away, start your mashed potatoes.


The mashed potatoes are easy to make as well. Simply peel (or leave skin on for more texture), boil until tender, and mash!
You can go 100 different ways with seasoning mashed potatoes, but we kept things simple: a little salt, pepper, and olive oil, with a few dashes of almond milk for creaminess. SERIOUS yum. For more flavor, you could also add fresh garlic, herbs, or even some vegan parmesan cheese.

All that’s left to do is serve! For garnish, we went for more fresh thyme and a little parsley. Vegan parmesan adds a bit more flavor, but it’s certainly optional.

We hope you all LOVE this dish! It’s:
Super hearty
Comforting
Flavorful
Healthy
Fiber- + Protein-packed
Quick + Easy
& So tasty
This would make a delicious easy weeknight meal for two or a hearty side for four. It’s reminiscent of Shepherd’s Pie but far easier to make! Plus, you can sauce up the filling a bit more so it’s more like mashed potatoes and gravy. Total swoon!

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
POTATOES


1
pound
yellow potatoes, peeled and quartered evenly (I left on some skin for texture)


Sea salt + black pepper to taste


1-2
Tbsp
olive oil (if avoiding oil, add more almond milk or vegetable broth)


2-4
Tbsp
unsweetened almond milk or vegetable broth (for added moisture)




MUSHROOM LENTIL GRAVY


1
Tbsp
water
(or avocado or olive oil)


1/2
cup
chopped shallot


2
cups
sliced cremini (or button) mushrooms


1-2
Tbsp
coconut aminos


1
Pinch
each salt and pepper


2
Tbsp
chopped fresh thyme 
(or sub rosemary // use dried if fresh is unavailable)


2/3
cup
dry green lentils
(rinsed + drained // optional: soak overnight in cool water to improve digestibility)


2-3
cups
vegetable broth
(or store-bought)


1
Tbsp
tomato paste
(optional)


2
Tbsp
mashed potatoes 
(recipe above // for thickness)




GARNISH optional


Fresh chopped parsley


Vegan Parmesan Cheese





Instructions



Heat a large rimmed pan over medium heat. Once hot, add oil or water and shallot and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.


Add mushrooms and coconut aminos and increase heat to medium-high. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.


Add thyme, lentils, and 2 cups (480 ml // or the smaller end of the range if adjusting recipe size) vegetable broth. Bring to a low boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and cook on low for about 20 minutes, adding more broth as needed if the mixture looks dry.


In the meantime, add potatoes to a large pot and cover with water so they are just submerged. Bring to a boil on high heat and cook for 12-15 minutes or until they slide off easily when pierced with a knife.


Once tender, drain potatoes and add back to pot or a mixing bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of olive oil and mash until tender and fluffy. For added moisture in place of oil, add unsweetened plain almond milk or vegetable broth.


Once lentils are tender, taste sauce and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt or coconut aminos for saltiness, pepper for spice, or tomato paste for more depth of flavor (optional - we didn't find it necessary). Turn off heat and let the mixture rest so flavors can deepen. Add the 2 Tbsp (30 g // or more as needed) mashed potatoes to the lentil mushroom stew and stir in to thicken.


To serve, divide mashed potatoes between serving plates or bowls and top with desired amount of lentil and mushroom gravy. Garnish with fresh parsley, vegan parmesan cheese, or more thyme, if desired.


Store leftovers separately, covered, up to 4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop or in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until hot.

I have been adapting to a whole food plant based way of eating and this has become a “go-to” recipe for lentils that I seem to be making on a weekly basis now.  There is something that is so satisfying as lentil gravy on mash potatoes.   I have been using shiitake mushrooms with it and for the mash potatoes I don’t bother peeling for extra nutrition and it makes it even less work!  Easy recipe.   This is so yummy.

Incredible! So simple, yet so rich in flavor. This is my husband’s new favorite meal. MB, THANK YOU!
I added a head of roasted garlic to the mashed potatoes, followed everything else exactly and it was delicious!
Actually remembered to double the recipe this time as I’m learning that if it’s from MB we are going to want leftovers!!!

I had some leftover lentils I needed to use up.  This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  So comforting, savory, and satisfying.  My somewhat picky teen boy even liked it.  Anything with mashed potatoes is usually a win- this did not disappoint!  I didn’t use the optional tomato paste (I didn’t want to then have tomato paste to have to use up), skipped the oil also.  Otherwise I made it pretty much as is.  I don’t eat a lot of  lentils- this will certainly change that!  This will be in regular rotation.  Thanks for all the great recipes.

I have made this a couple of times. 
Tonight, I made it with mushroom stock (store bought, College Inn brand) and it really brought a delicious depth of flavor. I also used soy sauce instead of coconut aminos. The first time I made this, I used dried thyme and this time I used fresh – the fresh was 100x better and didn’t leave chewy pieces the way the dried thyme did. 
However, my lentils were not evenly cooking with the 2 c of broth (the ones on top stayed hard because 2 c did not cover them completely), so I ended up adding more and more liquid, using 4 c total (I used the whole container of broth) and had to cover my pan as well. I think my lentils did not cook evenly the first time either, but it’s an easy enough fix that I wouldn’t dock the instructions (it could totally be something I’m doing wrong). This is a great recipe regardless! I served it with your Best Damn Vegan Mashed Potatoes recipe and used fresh roasted garlic in the potatoes.

I thought it was just okay. Maybe mine was not as great as the other reviewers because I used store bought broth? Otherwise I followed the recipe to a “T”. Could just be personal preference in taste. Idk.

Tasty, versatile dish! I soaked a package of dried porcini mushrooms and added them along with the button mushrooms, and threw in some of the soaking water as well since I was a little short on broth. I accidentally used dried oregano instead of dried thyme (whoops!) but it still turned out good. I added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end for a little extra zip and served it over egg noodles.

This dish is so much more than the sum of its parts–and that’s considering how awesome its individual parts are. I doubled the recipe, using tamari instead of coconut aminos and vegetable broth to mash the potatoes. I mostly eyeballed amounts, and the final product is still scrumptious. As promised, this recipe was definitely easy and quick to make.
I’ve been writing this review for a while now because I keep stopping to eat more. True story.

I’ve made this recipe twice and first time lentils were not nearly tender after 20 minutes, it took about 40-50 minutes for them to cook through. I used brown unsoaked lentils. Second time I pre-cooked lentils in Pressure cooker for 7 minutes and it turned out amazing.

Wonderful! Made it two nights ago and was surprised at how well it turned out.

A great, easy, mid week stew for the rotation. Thank you!

And the mashed potatoes were just as good as they would be with milk & butter if not better! I never thought to use veggie broth instead of milk!

I have tried this recipe 4 times and each time the lentils take close to an hour to cook. I am using red lentils, I am almost using to much liquid so I know they are not in want of that, I’ve trie this on low, medium low and high heat but nothing gets the time to 20 minutes. what am I doing wrong? do the lentils need to be soaked? I’ve looked for other red lentil recipes and they all say 20 minutes as well but nothing about soaking.

Reply






Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
June 10, 2019 at 12:43 pm 

Andrew, red lentils should generally take only 5-10 minutes to cook – they’re so small and tender. Green and brown and black varieties can take longer. One option is to cook the lentils separate in boiling water until tender to speed cooking, and then add them to the sauce. Hope that helps!

Reply






OkraW says 
October 21, 2019 at 11:57 pm 

Andrew, are you maybe using whole red lentils? There is a split version that does not need to be soaked (although I always soak at least for 30 mins with split lentils). For whole lentils, I’d still soak overnight or least 8 hours. It should quicken the cook time significantly once you get cooking!

Hi team Minimalist Baker, do you think water would work instead of veggie broth? I am in a place where store-bought is not readily available and I may not find time to make my own… if I do attempt it with water, what should I tweak?

It won’t have as much flavor, so that’s my main concern. I’d add a bit of tomato paste, nutritional yeast, and more onion / garlic to the pan to help compensate if I were you.

This stew was SO SO delicious and hearty. My lentils took a bit longer to cook (about 10 minutes more), so I just kept them simmering, adding hot water little by little if they looked dry, until the lentils were perfect. I served these with the aptly named “Best Damn Vegan Mashed Potatoes” instead of the mash in this recipe. The chives and garlic in the potatoes went really well with the stew. Served at a dinner party and multiple people asked me to send them the recipe. :)

Finally tried this today after saving to pinterest ages ago. It was absolutely fantastic! I was making it ahead of time, so wasn’t making the mashed potatoes, so instead of mashed potatoes to thicken, I used 2 tablespoons cornstarch beaten with 1/4 cup of water. Worked great. Can’t wait to make again – it was such a warm and hearty dish to eat a cold winter’s evening.

This is pure comfort food to be sure.
I used black lentils that I soaked all day. I added carrots to mine too. I also used my InstaPot to cook the stew. Decreased liquid to 2 cups and cooked the stew for 15 minutes on high.
The flavors were perfectly blended. I let the stew bubble on the sauté setting for five additional minutes to further reduce liquids befor stirring in mashed potatoes.
I used a combination of red and gold baby potatoes for the mash. I added vegan keifer I made in the InstaPot to give the potatoes a tangy flavor.  Yum!
This recipe is husband approved.  And will definitely make it again and serve over polenta.

Excellent recipe, easy to make.  I prefer using rosemary and 365 vegetable stock from Whole Foods.  I use a bit of veg. stock to mash the potatoes.  Thank you for another great meal!

I made the mashed potatoes the night before in my instant pot.
I used the same amount of potatoes and put just enough water to cover them in the instant pot, then cook on high heat/pressure for 10 minutes. Instead of using vegetable broth in the potatoes,  I used the leftover potato-water. 
It was really yummy!

I have been making recipes off this amazing site for awhile now, and this recipe was so delicious that I decided I just have to leave a review and start contributing.  I only used 2 cups vegetable broth but next time I will use more because it would be nice to have more sauciness to put over the potatoes. I also sauteed a bunch of garlic in 2 Tbsp of avocado oil and then added that into the mashing of potatoes for some extra flavor. Did not end up using tomato paste. Must try! I will definitely be making this again

The short YouTube video and the short list of ingredients convinced me to make this recipe. Next time, I   need to double the amount so I have some leftover. I didn’t have coconut aminos, so I used soy sauce instead. Great for winter!

So. Good. I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it! So hearty and filling. I made noodles on the side so it was more of a pot-roast kind of dish. I had some leftovers so I just added a little bit of leftover tomato soup to them and it was delicious! This is such a versatile dish that you can really make your own. And so simple for me, as someone who doesn’t cook a lot. I’ll definitey make it again.

I think a little white or red wine in the gravy would really work here.
Keep an eye on this as it cooks as you definitely may want to add more broth to keep it saucy! Mine dried up a bit.
I see someone else blended a little of the gravy and I love that idea!

I made it and it was delicious! I work for a health care facility where I cook for home bound people with HIV and various cancers. I make a bunch of meals during the week and freeze them to be delivered every Tuesday. I wanted to start making one vegetarian or vegan meal a month to see how the clients like it so I started with this! A couple of  changes- I added more veggies to the stew, spinach carrot and zucchini (because I had it on hand). Then I swapped out the yellow potatoes for sweet potatoes and cauliflower. I added brown butter, a little cayenne and minced garlic. Wish I could show you the pics, it turned out great! Thanks a lot!

I made this recipe and it was so hearty and delicious. I put my cooked potatoes in the food processor and whipped them up and that was SO delicious with it. I added garlic powder and rosemary because I love that. My roommate who doesn’t like the texture of mushrooms loved it but had to eat around the mushrooms so when she made the recipe herself, she bought Pacifica brand mushroom soup and used that instead because she doesn’t like the texture. I know many people don’t love the texture of mushrooms so if it looks good to you, try that! This is one of my favorite recipes I’ve tried so far.

Hi Dana, 
How did you manage to cook your lentils in about 20 minutes? I made this recipe today, and let me tell you, it did not take 20 minutes. I soaked them over night, I cooked them for two almost 3 hours, and they were not soft yet. Did you do anything different? I’d appreciate some tips. Aside from the cooking time being long, the recipe is delicious.

First of all, this was delicious!! The recipe is easy to follow and I’d highly recommend! Something about the combo of mashed potatoes and lentils was just absolutely heavenly. My ONLY critique/suggestion is regarding the cook time for the lentils. As others point out, 20 min on low is definitely not long enough. I didn’t time how long it took to cook after my 20 min timer went off, but very possibly was closer to 40 min. I waited until most of the liquid had dissolved from the 2cups of veg broth & it was perfect. The video was extremely helpful in showing the type of consistency that the strew should have after fully cooked.

This was so flavorful and lovely. I’ll admit I was skeptical before making it, thinking there was no way such simple ingredients could come together into a comforting dish (and help me get over my craving for mashed potatoes, steak and gravy). And I was reeeeaaaally hesitating with those 2 tablespoons of thyme – it just seemed like an awful lot. But I trusted the recipe and went forward. 
Boy am I glad I did! I’m so surprised by how comforting and delicious this is! I made it for my meal prep, can’t wait to eat it all this week!

I made this last night for dinner, and it was excellent. I didn’t have tomato paste, so I substituted red miso with a splash of apple cider vinegar, and it seemed to work just fine! 
I used rosemary instead of thyme, and rather than add the chopped herbs to the stew, I bruised a sprig of rosemary and added it to the pan, removing it after about 15 minutes. Rosemary can be overpowering for me, and this gave it a great flavor without being overwhelming.

This is one of my favorite things I’ve cooked – I made some tweaks as I have no dietary restrictions and used what was on hand (butter and half & half in the potatoes, chicken broth instead of veggie broth, soy sauce instead of coconut aminos, included the tomato paste) – but I’m certain the dish would be good without my changes. I found the fresh thyme to be a key player in the flavor, so include it if you can! I served the dish in bowls topped some garlicky sautéed kale. It all held up wonderfully as leftovers as well.

I have made this 3 times now. My husband and I are on the Whole Foods Plant Based Diet right now, so the first time I made this, I mashed the potatoes (and skins) with vegetable broth,  and water sautéed the onions and mushrooms. Yum, yum, yum.
The second time I made this, I forgot to get fresh thyme so I used dried thyme. So good. Also, I put it on top of baked potatoes.  Less muss, less fuss, still good.
The last time I made the Lentil Mushroom Stew I put it on spelt macaroni. My husband says that was his favorite way of eating it.
By the way, I did not need to add the potato to thicken it. I am amazed at how simple, yet how yummy it is! Thanks!

This was so good! I am having a ‘minimalist baker week’ – this is the fourth recipe of yours I made this week! We are not vegan so I made regular mashed potatoes since so far I have not yeat eaten vegan mashed potatoes that I enjoyed as much. I also used about double the amount of mushrooms because we just really love them. At the end we each added a teaspoon of nutritional yeast to our plates. The whole family enjoyed it, my 1-year-old ate almost an adult sized portion and my 3-year-old kept asking for more even after she’d had dessert!

Hi Emma! You can easily sub gluten-free tamari or soy sauce! Coconut aminos is a soy-free alternative to soy sauce, with a less pungent flavor. I usually double the amount of coconut aminos I would add to a recipe that calls for soy sauce. So, if a recipe calls for 2 Tbsp soy sauce/tamari, I’d probably add 3-4 Tbsp coconut aminos. Hope that helps!

Just made this – absolutely love it.  I do feel it really needed more than 20 minutes to cook to soften the green lentils.   Its another rainy day here and perfect dinner for a night like this.   I tagged you in instagram with a photo.

We made this last night and it was delish! I have one kid who struggles with the texture of cooked mushrooms, so I diced them up teensy tiny and even she had second helpings. I added diced carrot, which was yummers.  :-)

Gorgeous! This is a lovely recipe. It’s autumn/fall here in Australia, so this is perfect for the cooler weather.  I’ll add some spinach or kale next time, just to sneak more greens in. I think it’ll work nicely with the flavours of the broth. I worked with what I had, so some minor changes:
– Canned lentils, instead of dried.
– 1tbsp tamari, instead of coconut aminio
– 1 cube of massel stock with 1 cup of hot water, instead of x2 cups of broth.
– Chives, instead of shallots
– Added some garlic

Loved how savory this was…did not pull the stems off of the thyme and I do regret that!

Made it. Really yummy even though I changed things due to not having ingredients! Used onion instead of shallot and chicken broth (sorry ;)  instead of veggie broth. Served over a mix of yukon gold and cauliflower mash. Next time I’m going to try tamari instead of the coconut aminos because they seem to be a bit sweet. Really enjoyed it! Served with fresh sauted asparagus with garlic.  I maya add some fresh spinach next time. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

One of my all-time fav Minimalist Baker recipes. Super easy to make and the flavor is AMAZING! I added fresh garlic and kale to the lentil mixture and it was ?. I also added the tomato paste and loved it, and I used Tamari instead of coconut aminos. My boyfriend had two HUGE helpings.

I did add the tomato paste – not because it lacked flavor but because I was curious.  Highly recommend!!  Thanks for a great dinner!

If I soak the lentils beforehand, do I still use 2/3 of a cup (since they expand)? Or should I measure 2/3 c before soaking?
Additionally, should I adjust the amount of broth if I soak beforehand?

I used water to Sauté, subbed better than bouillon for broth and yellow onion for shallot, left out the tomato paste and salt, and used an Italian dry spice mix instead of the herbs mentioned. I did have to add quite a bit more water than was called for but that may have been because the stove I was cooking on doesn’t have low enough heat to simmer. I didn’t miss the oil or tomato paste at all. It was a huge hit! I will definitely be making it again.

In the wise words of Owen Wilson; “Wow.”
Didn’t think your recipes could get any better, but here we are. This was perfect timing too, as I had some mushrooms I wanted to use up. 
My lentils and mushrooms didn’t turn out as stew-y as yours did, despite using 3 cups of broth in addition to more water, but I think that could have been because my stove is finicky and difficult to get mid-range temperatures (it’s either blazing hot or lighter than a simmer), so my temp could have been too high. I think next time I’ll add even more mushrooms. 
Other than that, flavors were spot on. Major comfort dish here; seriously recommend.

What would be good to add to get an extra kick of protein?
Recipe looks great!

This is actually quite protein rich! But you could double the lentils (just add more broth to compensate).

When I make your lentil chili or sloppy Joe’s, I serve the leftovers over mashed potatoes with (your recipe) garlic parmesan green beans…we have this every week…so good! I cook almost exclusively from your cookbook & website & I thank you for making our transition to vegan eating so easy & delicious!

Could you sub red lentils?

Reply






Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
April 4, 2018 at 4:10 pm 

You can, but red lentils cook faster and tend to become mushier. So if you’re OK with that, go for it!

Hi
What is coconut aminos ?
I’m living in Mexico and not sure if I can find this item ….what could I substitute with??
Gracias, Lisa

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
April 4, 2018 at 11:22 am 

You can easily sub gluten-free tamari or soy sauce! Coconut aminos is a soy-free alternative to soy sauce, with a less pungent flavor. I usually double the amount of coconut aminos I would add to a recipe that calls for soy sauce. So, if a recipe calls for 2 Tbsp soy sauce/tamari, I’d probably add 3-4 Tbsp coconut aminos. Hope that helps!

I am imagining a mashed potato bowl with the potatoes as the base, this stew on top and to the side, and add some greens to the bowl, maybe collard greens, sautéed with onions and garlic and maybe even a roasted red pepper into the mix…   Shopping today, making this for tomorrow.
I love your recipes and how imaginative they are. You inspire me!

Technically it’s Spring here but just had massive rain showers coming down. In other words: while the season asks for salads, the weather (and me) wants comfort food.
This seems just perfect for tonight, though I think instead of mashed potatoes I’ll go for polenta (and use some potato starch to thicken the sauce if needed).

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

Agreed! It’s still cold and rainy in our neck of the woods. Comfort food it is!

Or… a friend unexpectedly dropped by with a bottle of wine and takeout… (the downside of being your own boss and working from home is also the plusside, I’m guessing you know how it works)
But tomorrow it should still be raining. Forgive me the one day delay. :D
(also: your vegan biscuits are killer! make them way too often.)
