Gado Gado with Spicy Peanut Sauce (30 Minutes!)


We’ve previously shared a recipe for Gado Gado — a quick, simple, and flavorful Indonesian-inspired dish perfect for weeknight cooking. We love that recipe so much we wanted to share a slightly different, but equally simple and delicious variation.
This version uses sweet potato instead of carrots, swaps the red cabbage for extra green beans, and includes an optional egg. Oh, and we kicked things up a notch with a spicy version of the peanut sauce. Let’s do this!


The base of this 30-minute recipe is brown rice. It’s quick and easy to make, plus rich in vitamins and minerals such as selenium, magnesium, and vitamin B3.
To make this bowl extra filling and delicious, we also roasted coated sweet potato rounds until perfectly tender and sweet.

For a pop of green and a bit of crunch, we steamed green beans until just tender, then added them to ice water to stop the cooking and keep them fresh and vibrant.
Not only are green beans delicious, they’re also loaded with vitamins and minerals including vitamins K, C, folate, B2, chromium, calcium, and so many more!


Next comes the peanut sauce! Simply whisk peanut butter, tamari, lime juice, maple syrup, and chili garlic sauce in a mixing bowl. Add water to thin and you’ve got a magical, versatile sauce!
The rice and veggies are divided between serving bowls, topped with cilantro and peanuts, and everything is drizzled with spicy peanut sauce.

We hope you LOVE this dish. It’s:
Flavorful
Quick & simple
Versatile
Perfectly spicy
Colorful
Healthy
& So tasty!
This recipe is perfect for quick weeknight dinners and make-ahead lunches but is also impressive enough to serve to company as it’s customizable and everyone can choose their own unique toppings.

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
RICE


1
cup
short grain brown rice, rinsed


1 ¾
cup
water


1
pinch
sea salt
(optional)




VEGETABLES


1
large (~200 g)
sweet potato, rinsed and chopped into 1/4-inch slices


1
Tbsp
avocado oil


8
ounces
green beans, stems removed 
(8 ounces equals ~40 beans)


1/2
medium
red bell pepper, thinly sliced


3/4
cup
bean sprouts 
(or use more bell pepper)




PEANUT SAUCE


1/4
cup
natural salted peanut butter


1
Tbsp
tamari 
(or soy sauce if not gluten free)


1-2
Tbsp
fresh lime juice


1-2
Tbsp
maple syrup


2-3
tsp
chili garlic sauce 
(more or less depending on preferred level of spice)


1-4
Tbsp
hot water




FOR SERVING


Fresh chopped cilantro


2-3
Tbsp
roasted salted peanuts
(optional)


Hard-boiled egg*
(optional)





Instructions



In a large saucepan, bring water and brown rice to a boil, then add a pinch of salt, swirl to combine, cover, and reduce heat to simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes until water is absorbed and rice is tender and fully cooked. Drain off any excess liquid at the end if there is any. Set rice aside and cover to keep warm.


In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add sliced sweet potato and drizzle with avocado oil. Bake for 20-25 minutes. When ready, rounds should be tender and slightly golden brown. Set aside.


While potato rounds and rice are cooking, steam your green beans in a steamer basket or in the microwave for 3-4 minutes. Alternatively, add to boiling hot water for 1 minute, then transfer to ice water to stop the cooking process (a.k.a. “shocking”). Drain and set aside.


Prepare the peanut sauce by adding all ingredients except water to a small mixing bowl and whisking. Add hot water 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time until desired consistency is reached — it should be pourable.


Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, or lime juice for acidity.


To assemble, divide brown rice between 3 dishes and top with roasted sweet potato, steamed green beans, sliced red pepper, bean sprouts, cilantro, and a hard-boiled egg (optional). Serve with spicy peanut sauce and salted roasted peanuts (optional). For extra heat, sriracha or extra chili garlic sauce make great additions.


Best when fresh. Store any leftovers separate from dressing in the refrigerator up to 2 days.

This is my new favorite recipe!  Made it tonight and everyone loved it!  So filling and satisfying.   I didn’t have any garlic chili sauce so i substituted sweet thai chili sauce and it was delicious. Added some sauted cabbage i had in the fridge and a few steamed carrots.   My husband has already requested having this again on the weekend. ?

Love this! It was so meaty and filling from the sweet potato. A few coworkers observing me with my leftovers thought I was pouring peanut butter over the dish though and ended up trying some of the sauce at my insistence and were surprised at how delicious it was. Will definitely make it again soon!

Very delicious. I had some extra spinach on hand and added that as well. Will make again for sure!

I am Indonesian and I come across your blog to find ideas on how to create a personal blog and see my favorite food! Although yours isn’t precisely the gado-gado we make here, it is however close. You need to add several cayenne pepper (not red bell pepper but I suppose it depends on how you prefer to make it) in it to make all the taste come together. Don’t use maple syrup because if you do, that’s not gado-gado anymore ;) instead, use palm sugar but not the one in the plastic. The block palm sugar. I don’t know if you have it over there. Anyway yeah, that’s about it. But glad to see you make one :)

Literally eating this as I’m writing… wow SO freakin good!! Warm, fresh, spicy, a little sweet. I’m so into it. I made this with coconut brown rice and subbed the egg for some tofu since I had eggs for breakfast. Comes together so quickly while the potatoes are in the oven! Had the bowl waiting, threw the sweet potatoes in and devoured immediately. Awesome week night dinner. Already excited to eat leftovers!

Hi, this looks so delicious, will def make it for dinner this week! One question though: do you know how long the dressing will keep for in the fridge?

Hi Tove, the dressing will probably last longer than the rest- up to 1 week.

Thank you! Will definitely make a double batch then? Also, what can I substitute the maple syrup with (a bit tricky to find maple syrup over here?)

YUM. This looks so good! Thinking of maybe subbing some crispy tofu to replace the egg to keep it vegan. Anything with a peanut sauce is a winner in my book. Thanks so much for sharing, Dana!

This was so good! It did take longer than 30 minutes to make. Next time I will make rice and eggs ahead of time. I roasted the red pepper with some avocado oil and salt pepper along with the potatoes instead of leaving them raw. This was a hit with my husband and son as well. Just wish I had more for left overs.  The combination was so tasty and filling. Add a few peanuts as suggested, so good!

So good!!!! I love the name of this dish! I skinned my sweet potatoes, brushed olive oil on them, and put them in the oven for 27 minutes because they were still too soft along the edges at 25 minutes for my liking. I also used store bought peanut sauce and used my rice cooker to make the rice! Overall, this was a super low maintenance meal and tasted awesome  : >

Never tried Gado Gado before, but HOLY SMOKES does it look fantastic. Sweet potatoes, peanut sauce, and roasted vegetables sound perfect together. I want to try out the peanut sauce with almond butter one day, just out of sheer curiosity. I know it would be a lit grittier, but the flavor would still be lovely!

I followed the sauce recipe for the most part, except I had to replace cashews for the peanuts due to an allergy in our home.  It was delicious.  We poured it over sauted veggies I had in the fridge and brown rice noodles.  I have one very particular eater and he ate two bowls.  The whole family loved it.
