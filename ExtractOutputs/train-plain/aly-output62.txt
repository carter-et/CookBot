Fluffy Almond Butter Sweet Potato Muffins (GF)



Many of you have enjoyed our Sweet Potato Almond Butter Muffins, but asked if they could be made gluten-free.
We thought so, but we knew they’d need a few tweaks. Spoiler alert: Major success!
These revamped sweet potato muffins are gluten-free, naturally sweetened, oil-free, and require just 10 ingredients to prepare. Let’s bake!



These start with roasting a sweet potato, peeling off the skin, and then mashing it to make a purée.
The purée is mixed with maple syrup for sweetness, almond butter for richness, and an egg to provide a nice fluffy texture.

Dairy-free milk is added to thin the batter, baking powder to help the muffins rise, and pumpkin pie spice for a boost of flavor.
We’ve found that when baking with gluten-free flours, it’s typically best to use a mix of different flours to achieve the ideal texture and flavor. So in this recipe, we use our DIY gluten-free blend, almond flour, and oat flour to achieve that balance. 

Then simply add batter to baking cups and top each with a swirl of almond butter. We’re drooling already.

We hope you LOVE these muffins! They’re:FluffyFlavorfulPerfectly spicedRich in beta-carotene (that makes vitamin A!)& Incredibly delicious

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


1
cup
sweet potato purée 
(~1 large sweet potato, as recipe is written)


1/3
cup
maple syrup


1/4
cup
salted creamy almond butter 
(if unsalted, add 1/4 tsp sea salt as recipe is written // or sub other nut or seed butter of choice)


1
large
egg 
(or sub 1 batch flax egg per egg — though we haven’t tested it that way)


2/3
cup
unsweetened almond milk or cashew milk


1 ½
tsp
baking powder


2
tsp
pumpkin pie spice


1/2
cup
gluten-free flour blend


2/3
cup
almond flour


1/4
cup
oat flour 
(ground from rolled oats)




FOR TOPPING 


~3
Tbsp
roasted salted almond butter





Instructions



To make sweet potato purée, halve sweet potato and brush the cut-sides with oil (optional). Place on parchment-lined baking sheet and bake at 375 F (190 C) for ~25-30 minutes or until tender to the touch. Let cool  for 5 minutes. Then peel away skin and mash in a mixing bowl (or food processor). Set aside.


Adjust oven temperature to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a standard muffin tin with paper liners.


Add sweet potato purée, maple syrup, almond butter, and egg to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Then add almond milk and whisk again.


Add baking powder and pumpkin pie spice and whisk once more. Then add gluten-free flour, almond flour, and oat flour and stir to combine. The batter should be slightly thick and scoopable, not easily pourable (see photo). If too thin, add more almond flour or GF flour. If too thick, thin with a small amount of dairy-free milk.


Scoop batter into muffin tins (I like doing this using an ice cream scoop) until filled almost to the top (as the recipe is written, there should be 12 muffins). Then drop about 1/2 tsp almond butter onto the center of each muffin and gently swirl around with a toothpick or knife.


Bake for 26-30 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick in the center comes out clean (a few small crumbs are okay, just as long as it’s not gooey). Remove from oven and let rest in tins for 10 minutes. Then transfer to a cooling rack to let cool completely.


Cool completely (the wrapper comes off easiest that way). Store in an air-tight container at room temperature up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month.

Wonderful recipe, I made these vegan with a flax egg. Also, the pumpkin spice recipe with the cardamom and pepper is so good. I didn’t have pumpkin spice so I was thrilled when I realized I had all the ingredients for the pumpkin spice.  These muffins are so yummy!

I loved it!! I made it with All purpose flour because I did not have any others in hand and I really wanted to try making this!!  When I make this again, I’m  only adding the baking powder at the end of the process… I find that when I over mix the Baking Powder, my muffins are not as fluffy.

I give this recipe 5 stars! I used frozen sweet potato purée chunks from Trader Joe’s and it did the trick—but I loved this recipe so much that I think it’s worth roasting and using a real sweet potato! I found this recipe to be pretty simple and it’ll be a new go-to!

OMG!!! Thank you so much! Made it with more almond flour as we have an oat sensitivity in the fam. Also I didn’t peel the potato and put it together with all the ingredients besides the flours in a normal blender. This recipe is absolutely delicious and I had to restrain myself from eating the raw batter. Without the flour I wonder if it could be made into ice cream?

This receipe turned out wonderful.You can’t even taste the sweet potato.The spices were reminding me of apple muffins. I used coconut flour, almond flour and tapioca flour. The texture looks exactly like the picture even though I used different flours then what the receipe suggested. Will bake these again.

Hi Zarina, we haven’t tried these modifications, but our best suggestions would be ground cashews (cashew flour) or sunflower seed flour for the almond flour and a chia egg for the egg. Let us know if you give it a try!

I just made these this morning. Absolutely Delicious ! Swapped the GF flour for speltflour! I thought they were a little pale when they came out the oven. So i glaced them with maple syrup and popped the tray back in the oven for A few more minutes and they came out even more perfectly! Definitely will make them again! ?

I loved this recipe! For the gluten-free flour blend I did a 1/4 cup buckwheat, 2 Tbs coconut flour and 1 Tbs flaxseed meal- to equal 1/2 cup. I also added 1/4 tps more of salt to my raw almond butter for the batter portion. I used chunky almond butter, which added a nice texture too. Overall, they were moist and delicious  and not overly sweet.
Thank you so much! I love trying new recipes from you!

I made these using a flax egg and added some extra spices (more cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger) and they turned out great! Even the non-vegans I shared them with agreed. They only made 10 muffins, though… Maybe my sweet potato was too small? At any rate, I’ll be making them again for sure.

Looking at the pictures of your tin and finished muffins, I’m fairly certain mine weren’t bigger than the ones you shared. I think probably I had less batter due to a smaller sweet potato. Having weights in the recipe could help.

This was an absolutely wonderful recipe!  I made this treat for my family yesterday and they loved it.  The muffin was moist and full of flavor.  More, it was not too sweet; wonderful if you are cutting back on sugar but still need a treat.  I must admit that my batter was a bit “wet” due to using pumpkin puree (I had forgotten to roast a sweet potato and needed a dessert for the evening).  The recipe accounted for this however.  I simply added a bit more oat flour and GF flour blend.  Cooking time was extended by a few minutes.  Will I make this recipe again?  YES, I WILL!  Thank you, Minimalist Baker!

Obsessed with this recipe! I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice, and I also used all-purpose flour instead of GF flour blend. The result was beautiful; nutty flavour from the almond butter, and a subtle sweetness from the sweet potato created a super soft and delicious muffin! Thanks for the recipe :) 
PS: I love the direction your blog has gone – in providing both vegan and non-vegan recipes. So sorry that you have to deal with negative comments every time you post a non-vegan recipe – your recipes have helped me greatly in improving my own cooking skills, and I don’t understand the need for harsh judgement from others!

I just made these tonight, and it’s another HIT! I was too lazy to blend oats into flour and no GF flour so I just used 3/4 cup spelt flour and 2/3 cup almond flour and it turned out so good. It’s so soft, not too sweet and nutty. I always feel good about serving your creation to my toddler because they feel so wholesome while tasting delicious. Thank you Dana!

This is strange! Did you modify any of the ingredients (not the measurements per say)? Do you live in a higher altitude? Happy to help troubleshoot as they should be fluffy and perfectly cooked. Also, did you let them cool slightly before eating or did you eat as soon as they were cooked? They need a little time to cool (as do most baked goods).

Yum! They are so fluffy! It’s lightly and perfectly sweet and a little savory. I live at high altitude (3600’) and find I bake most recipes at least 5 minutes less including this one. I had just a bite but can’t wait to have them for breakfast! I ended up pureeing the sweet potato with maple syrup and almond butter to get it a little more creamy and mashed (the fork wasn’t cutting it). Thanks for all the gluten free goodness!

I will be making these tonight.  Since we are not gluten free I would like to replace the gluten free flour with a whole grain flour.  Do you think WW pastry flour, spelt flour or white wheat flour would be a satisfactory replacement or do I need to stick with white AP flour for the best texture?  This recipe came at a perfect time since I have some leftover sweets from making our smoothies this morning.  Thank you for your healthy and delicious recipes!  Mary Beth
