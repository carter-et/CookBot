Roasted Stuffed Butternut Squash


Are you into roasted squash? What about crispy quinoa, kale, and caramelized mushrooms?
If so, I have just the dish for you! In addition to our new go-to Vegan Lentil Nut “Meatloaf,” I wanted to share another main dish for the holidays (and beyond). Plus, the ingredients happen to be some of my favorites this time of year, so it was just meant to be. Let me show you how easy it is!

This dish requires just 10 ingredients and simple methods to prepare.
It starts by cooking your quinoa and roasting your squash until golden and tender. The squash gets a flavor boost from salt and a little coconut sugar.

Next, you can prepare your balsamic reduction by simply cooking over low flame for 15 until a syrup forms. And all that’s left is sautéing your cooked quinoa, mushrooms, kale, and walnuts (optional). Once your squash is tender, stuff with your quinoa filling and bake another 5 minutes until hot. That’s it!

For garnish we went with our balsamic reduction and our beloved crispy shallot to add a savory crunch to the top. It’s optional but highly recommended and can be prepared while your squash is roasting!


We hope you love this squash! It’s:
Savory-sweet
Super hearty
Easy to make
Customizable
& a delicious main or side!
This would make the perfect entrée or side dish this holiday season, for friend and family gatherings, or a slow weekend treat. (Plus, it reheats beautifully making it perfect for leftovers!) While delicious on its own, we can’t help but want to pair it with our Vegan Garlic Mashed Cauliflower and Easy Vegan Gravy! Talk about the ultimate holiday feast.

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
VEGGIES & QUINOA


2
cups
cooked quinoa (cooked from ~3/4 cups raw - see instructions)


1
Tbsp
avocado or coconut oil


3
cups
loosely packed sliced shiitake mushrooms


2
T
coconut aminos (or sub tamari, but start with a lesser amount as it’s saltier)


2
cloves
garlic, minced


2
cups
loosely packed chopped kale


1/2
cup
roughly chopped walnuts (or other nut or seed of choice)
(optional)




SQUASH


1
large butternut squash, halved lengthwise, seeds removed


1
Tbsp
avocado or melted coconut oil


2
Tbsp
coconut sugar


1/4
tsp
ground cinnamon
(optional)


Healthy pinch sea salt




FOR SERVING 


1
cup
balsamic vinegar (reduced down on stovetop)


Crispy Sautéed Shallot* (1 cup shallot or 2 medium shallots)
(optional)





Instructions



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and set out a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon liner or grease a 9x13-inch (or similar size) baking dish.


In the meantime, if you haven’t already done so, prepare quinoa by adding quinoa and water to medium saucepan and bringing to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 18-20 minutes, or until fluffy and the water is absorbed. Remove lid and let cool completely (uncovered)  on the stovetop.


Halve the squash lengthwise (tip and stem) by inserting your knife point into the squash and rocking toward the base. Then remove your knife, flip the squash around 180 degrees and insert the point into the same spot, but rock it toward the stem, pressing down firmly but carefully to split the squash in half.


Scoop out seeds with a spoon or ice cream scoop. Then brush with oil (or water) and sprinkle with coconut sugar, cinnamon (optional), and salt. Place cut-side down on a lined baking sheet or baking pan.


Bake squash for 15 minutes, then flip the squash over to cut-side up. Bake for another 30-45 minutes (sometimes more depending on the size of your squash), or until a knife easily pierces the squash (especially in thicker parts). It's better for the squash to be on the more tender side than firm, in our experience.


In the meantime, prepare your balsamic reduction by adding balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan and bringing to a low boil over medium high heat. Once bubbling, reduce heat to a healthy simmer - about medium low heat - and cook for about 12-15 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when it’s reduced in volume by about half, it appears syrupy, and it has visible bubbles on the top. Set aside to cool. It will thicken as it cools.


Once your quinoa is cooked and cooled, heat a large rimmed metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. One hot, add oil or water and quinoa. Sauté for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly crispy and browned. Season with half the coconut aminos for flavor. Then remove from skillet and set aside.


To the still hot skillet add the mushrooms and the other half of the coconut aminos. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and reduced in size. Then add garlic and kale and walnuts (optional) and sauté for another 1-2 minutes or until kale is just wilted. Then add quinoa back to the pan and toss to coat (see photo). Set aside.


Once your squash is roasted, place cut-side up on the baking sheet or dish and fill to the brim with quinoa filling. Then place back in the oven to roast another 5 minutes.


To serve, arrange on a serving platter or individual plates. We loved garnishing ours with some crispy pan-fried shallot*, parsley, and a drizzle of balsamic reduction. However, this would also pair well with a simple salad dressing like a vinaigrette, tahini dressing, or even Vegan Gravy.


Store leftovers covered in the fridge up to 4-5 days. Reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) until hot.









Notes
*To prepare crispy shallot, add 2 sliced shallots to a small bowl with 3 Tbsp (30 g) brown rice flour, 1/8th tsp each salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Heat a medium (preferably cast-iron) skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and floured shallots and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown and crispy - ~5 minutes.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated without optional ingredients.

Loved all the delicious flavours in this recipe! Loved the crunchy walnuts, juicy fresh shitakes, crispy kale, and soft sweet buttery (but vegan) squash. Will certainly be adding this to my routine meal list. Definitely a few more steps, but I prepped the kale, roasted the squash, and soaked the quinoa ahead of time, so it was pretty easy. …but I didn’t eat the peel ?

This looks great and I plan to make it tonight! Just a question that came up after I watched your video and saw that the fork contained the squash peel… to eat squash peel or not to eat…? I guess it likely depends on the squash variety, but I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I made this using 3 small butternut squash from our garden. It was delicious! I used a chopped shallot, but added them to the filling with the mushrooms instead of making crispy shallots. I added some sage to the filling as well, which gave it a nice, sausage-esque flavor. These were devoured by all, including my steak-and-potatoes guy. Thanks Dana!

I found the font size in printed version too small.  If you could squeeze some of the spacing and increase font, we seniors would like it.  Also, please state how many pages are in the print version – saves paper if we can judge how much to print (or edit out).  Thanks, eh, from Canada!

Thanks for the feedback, Ken! We will look at adding an option to increase the font size. As for how many pages it will be, your printer app should pop up with options to “print front and back” to save paper, as well as an estimate for how many pages will print. Hope that helps!

I will give this a 5-even though I have a lot of quibbles about it, b/c ultimately, it tasted good and was nutritious and is a dish I’ll probably make again, but with modifications.
My first quibble is the 15 min. prep. time. No way! With all that washing, chopping, measuring, cooking ahead of time (quinoa), browning, etc., it took me a good hr at least of prep time. The other part that took longer was roasting the butternut squash, and mine was only medium sized, but it probably took an hour and a half to get it tender enough.
Things I would change in future: I wouldn’t start roasting the squash cut side down. All the seasoning falls out. You have to turn in right side up in 15 min. and the sugar ends up burning. I had used just brown sugar & pats of butter instead of  the more exotic oils and coconut sugar (I’m not strictly vegan), so I tried to scoop that back into the squash when I turned them around. It was a really good suggestion to bake them on parchment paper. Also, the sprinkling of cinnamon was a nice addition.
      I would make the quinoa the day before, b/c I couldn’t get mine cooled down in the time frame. Also, I’d skip the browning of the quinoa as well as of the shallots. These steps took a lot of extra time and weren’t worth it in terms of enhancing flavor. I think I’d just saute the sliced shallots with the mushrooms and kale, and add the cooked quinoa without the browning. Or, maybe brown the quinoa kernels a bit before boiling them for a little roast flavor?
I didn’t have coconut aminos so I just used salt & pepper.  When I tried reducing the balsamic vinegar, it didn’t get syrupy so I finally stopped when it had boiled long enough. It did add a nice flavor to the kale. I used regular white mushrooms and brown (what I had on hand), and more than the recipe called for; also with the kale. I had a small bunch, so I chopped it all  (minus the toughest stems), and it was a lot more than what the recipe called for. But I think it all came out fine when I sauteed and mixed everything.
All in all, a tasty, hearty, filling, and nutritious dish.

Wow, this was incredible! I am never disappointed by the recipes I find on this blog! I followed the recipe closely only substituting coconut flour instead of brown rice flower for the crispy shallots and almond slices instead of walnuts. This recipe was , sweet with tartness and texture! I am definitely going to make this again but use baby bella  mushrooms instead because they are my favorite and a little less costly! I can’t wait to try more, you guys have me eating like a queen!

I made this for lunch today. I didn’t have butternut squash so I substituted acorn squash. Timing was the same. I should have used 2 as I had more quinoa stuffing than squash. I also cooked some sweet potatoes along side the squash. Very yummy. Everyone gobbled it down. Thanks Dana.

We’ve made this twice now, and it is the most underwhelming MB recipe to-date, in our opinion. The entire dish lacks on flavor, and we have made it using both coconut aminos and tamari. I would suggest using tamari for more saltiness, and adding in your favorite spices. We added cayenne, cumin, and garlic powder to jazz it up.
We love most of MB’s recipes, but will not be attempting this again.

This was really delicious! The flavors came together beautifully, the squash was soft, and the filling was hearty and perfect for a cold night. Cooking the balsamic vinegar made my whole house smell wonderful. I only question how your recipe provides 8 servings. The squash I found at the store was on the smaller side so I bought 2 and roasted 4 halves. There was plenty of filling for all four but there was no way a house of hungry vegans was going to share their delicious half with anybody else!
Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. My husband and I ate it for two dinners and a lunch. The reduced balsamic vinegar was delicious drizzled on the top.  On the “stuffing” part, I filled the seed cavity in the squash halves and then just piled the stuffing on the top. It worked well and looked beautiful. It heated up beautifully for leftovers, in the oven. As others have said, this recipe took much longer to make than the time suggested on the recipe.

First question: will this serve 8 as the main course?  I’m thinking 4.  Also, my prep is at least double your lusted time, sometimes up to four times longer! Do you assume everything is prepped and pre-measured before starting?  I never thought I was that slow!

I have teo questions.  Can we substitute another flour for the rice flour?   Because of the Arsenic levels in rice, i’m trying to avoid it as much as possible.
Also, although it’s not related to this recipe, but for the same reason – what would you substitute for Brown Rice Syrup in recipes?
