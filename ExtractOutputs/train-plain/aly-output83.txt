Vegan Palak Paneer with Curried Tofu



For years I’ve been wanting to make a plant-based take on palak paneer. The vibrant green color lures me in every time. Thankfully, this recipe is not only simple to make, but also incredibly delicious and requires just 30 minutes! Let me show you how it’s done.


This recipe starts with prepping your tofu in curry powder, coconut aminos, and nutritional yeast to mock the paneer or cheese in the classic take on the dish.

Next you’ll sauté onion, garlic, ginger, and serrano pepper with cumin seed. Once browned, you’ll add diced tomatoes and cook until tender.


While that’s happening, you’ll blanch some spinach and add to a blender with your sautéed vegetables. This creates a creamy base for the palak paneer, which will blend beautifully with your cheesy, crispy tofu!

All that’s left to do is heat the mixture briefly on the stovetop with some coconut milk and more spices and you’re good to go! Such a hearty and delicious 30-minute meal!

We hope you LOVE this dish! It’s:
