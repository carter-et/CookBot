The Tequila Sunrise, with its bright striations of color, evokes a summer sunrise. This simple classic has only three ingredients—tequila, grenadine and orange juice—and is served unmixed to preserve the color of each layer.



The Tequila Sunrise was created by Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice in Sausalito, Calif. The cocktail achieved notoriety after Mick Jagger began drinking it, and The Rolling Stones dubbed their 1972 tour “the cocaine and Tequila Sunrise tour.” The drink has been a part of the cocktail canon ever since.





































































Ingredients



2 oz Blanco tequila


4 oz Fresh orange juice


1/4 oz Grenadine


Garnish: Orange slice


Garnish: Cherry








Steps





Add the tequila and then the orange juice to a chilled highball glass.





Float the grenadine on top.





Garnish with an orange slice and a cherry.
