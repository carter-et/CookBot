Curried Cauliflower, Grape, & Lentil Salad

Say hello to our new favorite salad.
Believe it or not, it was inspired by one we tried in an airport! Of all the places to glean inspiration from…
But no matter the source, the end result is far more delicious than the original we tried (not to brag, but for real), and it’s insanely easy to make! Shall we?

This 30-minute recipe starts with a base of greens, cooked lentils, red grapes, and the star of the show: curry roasted cauliflower.
We tossed one head of cauliflower in a bit of salt, coconut oil (or water), and our DIY Curry Powder (swoon) and roasted it to perfection. The result is crispy-on-the-edge, tender-in-the-center cauliflower bursting with flavor.


Next comes the dressing, which is a mixture of our go-to Green Curry Paste – that color tho! – and tahini, resulting in a creamy, savory-sweet, punchy dressing that marries this salad together beautifully.
We hope you LOVE this salad! It’s:
Fresh
Packed with fruit + vegetables
Hearty
Satisfying
SUPER flavorful
Healthy
& Insanely delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you need something healthy and satisfying on the table fast! It also keeps well, which makes it ideal to make ahead and pack along for lunches throughout the week (just serve the lentils and cauliflower chilled).

Tbsp
curry powder 
(or store-bought)

Instructions



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Line a baking sheet (or more as needed) with parchment paper.


Add cauliflower to a mixing bowl and toss with coconut oil (or water), curry powder, and sea salt. Transfer to baking sheet and roast cauliflower for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and tender.


Prepare dressing by adding green curry paste, tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, salt, and pepper to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. If needed, thin with water until pourable.


Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more green curry paste for a stronger curry flavor, tahini for greater thickness, lemon juice for acidity, or maple syrup for sweetness.


Assemble salad by adding lettuce to a serving platter or bowl. Top with lentils, grapes, and cooked cauliflower and serve with dressing. Optional: garnish with fresh cilantro.


Best served fresh. Store leftovers in airtight container for 3-4 days. Store dressing separately for up to 1 week.

I made this recipe 3 times last month for all the potlucks I had to go to—and it was fantastic! I just loved it, and I only took a tiny bit home each time. The dressing was delicious, and I’m going to use the recipe for weekday bowls in the future. I made your green curry paste, in part because I can’t handle spicy heat, so I made it nice and mild.  Definitely a keeper! ??

Sooo yummy! We make this recipe often, it’s such a quick and impressive meal to put together! The dressing is probably one of my favorites I’ve tried! Made it a few days ago but didn’t have grapes, substituted some green apple and it was soo good as well!

I made this tonight and my mom and I loved it. The grapes were such a nice addition… I suggest using red grapes just for the visual… but green works well and were delicious too. 
I think you could also make this quinoa and it would taste great too. I also think it would be nice to top with sesame seeds or something like that… But it was still delicious and I totally would reccomend it.
BTW for those who aren’t as farmiliar with lentils… they cook to 2-3x their size… so for a cup of lentils you don’t need to do that much. I totally made that mistake. Whoops.

This was tasty. I commented earlier on the curry paste that it was a tad too acidic for our tastes, so I left the lemon juice out of this dressing and it was perfect. Our dressing was super spicy (which we love, we didn’t seed or remove the Serrano membranes for the curry paste). Therefore, the sweetness of the grapes were a perfect reprieve from the spiciness. My husband is a little picky and he wants me to make this again!

Delicious! But beware of what curry paste you use. 4.5 tbs is a ton if you have a spicy curry paste and I had to dilute it with a ton of coconut milk

Another delicious salad. I served it on kale, which I think was ‘hardy’ enough to take the weight of the other ingredients. The dressing was too spicy for me so next time I’ll halve the curry paste (I guess it all depends onto brand, I used store-bought).

We’ve been making this recipe once a month for a while now. The only thing I’ve ever changed is the grapes. They are not always affordable so I swap them out with whatever fruit is on sale at the time. Everyone I serve it to loves it.  My kids devour it! The dressing is where the magic happens.

I made this yesterday to take to a potluck.  Modified by leaving out the green curry paste (time factor) and lentils, and substituted sweet potatoes for some of the cauliflower.     It tasted fantastic and i got lots of compliments.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I would have given 5 stars but my mods make the recipe a touch different.

This salad was phenomenal! I followed the directions with no substitutions (except maybe a little extra lemon juice and I added hemp seeds for crunch), and used store-bought curry powder and green paste in the interest of time (will try the homemade versions soon!). The bold curry with the sweet grapes and the hearty lentils was the perfect combination for a summery salad. Delicious and incredibly filling– highly recommended!

I love this salad! Thank you! I have made it twice, once with raisins (instead of grapes) and kale, the next with grapes and salad greens. Both were great. I definitely recommend using the lemon in the dressing, the lime juice was all I had on hand for the second time I made it, and I preferred the lemon. This is one to make again and again.

This salad is awesome!  I made the green curry paste as directed in the linked recipe and so glad.  It is delicious and will definitely have many other uses.  I used cooked black barely I already had instead of cooking lentil and worked out well.  I feel like you can you use any grain you have handy and will be great.

This salad is amazing! I am in love with it’s bold flavors. Of course I am a curry fan anyway.  I took the extra step of making the curry powder recipe instead of using a premade mix from store since I had all of the spices on hand. Definitely worth the effort.

I made this for dinner last night (for my nonvegan/nonGF fiancé) and he loved it. He thought it was so creative. I loved it too!! I added brown Basmati rice to bulk the dish up for him! I would recommend the cilantro on top (I ended up adding more) because it gives it such a wonderful flavor. I also used the Thai Kitchen brand of green curry paste with success. Am definitely going to attempt to make my own paste in the future though as yours looks so vibrant and fresh in comparison to my jarred variety (whomp, whomp). Thanks, Dana! Another incredible recipe!

I made this with a thai curry paste that was neither green nor red ;-) and probably too spicy – I mixed in an avocado and some more water to make it milder and I used cashew  cream instead of tahini because I don’t like sesame. It turned out amazing and I’m definitely going to make it again. Some soft bread or pitas or so would be nice with it , and I think pineapple would be just as yummie as the grapes or could go in additionally! loved it! Thank you <3!

I just made this and it was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe pretty much exact except I cut back a bit on the curry paste because I was afraid it would be too spicy for my tastebuds. Even the curry on the cauliflower gave it a bit more zing than I was expecting. The juicy grapes paired with the zing of the curry really give you a mouth full of flavor! Delicious!
