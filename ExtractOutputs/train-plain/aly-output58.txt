1-Pot Tuscan-Style Beef & Lentil Soup



If you’re looking for a hearty, 1-pot meal to warm up with this winter, this is it.
I recently got an intense craving for a meaty, tomatoey soup with lentils and greens and had to have it. This was the (incredibly delicious) result. 
We hope you love it as much as we do. It’s been on repeat in our kitchen for the last several months! Let us show you how easily it comes together.



This 1-pot soup starts with sautéing onion and garlic. Red pepper flake adds a little heat, which is optional but recommended.
Next comes the meat. We’ve tested this recipe with lean ground beef, bison, and even some nice quality pork sausage, and all worked well. Our favorites, however, are beef and bison (vegan options below, too).

Next comes tomato paste for rich tomato flavor, then diced tomatoes and broth. We opted to add both dried basil and oregano for plenty of Italian-inspired notes. 
Lastly, lentils and kale are stirred in for some added plant protein and fiber.

How to Modify 
The recipe is written to include beef or bison. However, if vegan or vegetarian, feel free to omit the meat and double up on lentils or beans of choice.In addition to lentils, we also tested this soup with white beans and thoroughly enjoyed it! Other kinds of lentils (such as red lentils) would also work well.We opted for kale, but could also see other sturdy greens, such as collard greens, working well.

We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s:
HeartyFlavorfulQuick & easy to makeComfortingCustomizable& Seriously delicious
This would make the perfect quick, hearty weeknight meal. Top with our go-to Cashew Parmesan for the ultimate cozy dish! 
This recipe is also ideal for meal prep as it reheats beautifully throughout the week and freezes well!

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 
SOUP


1-2
Tbsp
neutral oil 
(such as avocado oil)


1/2
large
white or yellow onion, diced


1/2
tsp
each sea salt and black pepper, DIVIDED plus more to taste


6
cloves
garlic, minced


1/4
tsp
red pepper flake 
(omit for less heat)


1
lb.
ground beef or bison 
(grass-fed, organic, pasture-raised whenever possible // if vegan, omit and double amount of beans listed below)


3
Tbsp
tomato paste 
(plus more to taste)


1
15-oz
can diced tomatoes 
(with salt, add with juices)


1
quart
chicken broth 
(or sub beef // sub vegetable broth if vegan // 1 quart = 4 cups)


1
Tbsp
dried basil 
(or sub fresh to taste)


1
Tbsp
dried oregano 
(or sub fresh to taste)


1
15-oz
can white beans or lentils*, slightly drained 
(double amount if making vegan)


4
cups
kale (or other sturdy green), chopped 




FOR SERVING optional


Freshly minced parsley


Vegan parmesan cheese


Red pepper flake





Instructions



Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil. Let heat 30 seconds. Then add onion and a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and sauté until soft and translucent (~ 4 minutes), stirring frequently. Then add garlic and red pepper flake and sauté 1 minute more.


Add beef or bison and use spoon to break into small pieces. Then season with another healthy pinch each salt and pepper. Stir and cook until meat is browned (~4-5 minutes).


Add tomato paste and stir to combine. Then add diced tomatoes (with their juices), broth, dried basil, and dried oregano and stir. Add (drained) beans or lentils (both from canned*), season with another pinch salt and pepper, and stir.


Once simmering, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more red pepper flake for heat, tomato paste for tomato flavor / depth of flavor, salt and pepper to taste, or dried herbs to taste.


Add kale and one final pinch each salt and pepper, then stir. Cover and cook for a few minutes more, or until kale is wilted and green.


Serve hot as is, or garnish with fresh minced parsley, vegan parmesan cheese, and red pepper flake (all optional).


Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. Thaw from frozen before reheating. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop in a saucepan or pot over medium heat (covered) until warmed through. Add more broth or water as needed to thin.






 

Notes
*If wanting to use dry lentils, you will need to increase cook time by ~15 minutes. Avoid adding kale until the lentils are done.*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with avocado oil and grass-fed ground beef and without optional ingredients.

This is on repeat this winter. It’s delicious, hearty, and makes enough for two nights of dinner at my house. It’s really versatile too. I’ve added in a bunch of other veggies (mushrooms, peas) and white beans when I’ve run out of lentils. It also freezes beautifully. One of the best soups I’ve made. Thanks, Dana!!

Delicious! We made this tonight with ground lamb and half the amount of broth (veggie) to make it more stew-like, but followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was quick, easy and so satisfying! This will be a go-to recipe from now on.
Great work and thanks for sharing!

I’ve been following for a while on Instagram but this is the first recipe I made. So yummy! I used ground turkey and dried lentils (cuz it’s what I had). I also added about a cup of cooked brown rice with the kale to make the lentils a “complete protein”. Very, very tasty! My husband doesn’t typically like “healthier” options but he loved this. Thanks so much!

Are you using all lentils or also meat?
If adding meat, I’d say 1/2 cup lentils. If omitting meat, I’d say 1 – 1 1/2 cups lentils.

I am so saddened to see you promoting the use of dead animals in your recipient now.  Our planet and our bodies are being destroyed by meat consumption and I always loved to follow you because of your meat free recipient. Offering a vegan option while still promoting the torture Of mass animals and consuming food products that have been proven to hinder our bodies is not something I can get behind. I will be unsubscribing.

I used a cup of dry lentils and two 15-oz cans of white beans and was very happy with the result — it’s not quite stew-like, but definitely nice and hearty. Came together nice and fast and tastes great!

Thanks, Sadye! You can add less broth next time to get it more stew-like.

Looks delicious and I’ ll give it a try because my son (6yrs) loves lentils and hates ground meat. I’ d like to ask if I can use spinanh instead of kale (I can’t find round here and I grown my own spinach, brocoli etc) ? Thank you.

You can! Just add right before serving as spinach doesn’t weather as well when stored in the fridge / being reheated.

Love all of your recipes. Every one has a been a winner.  I see you can sub beef for white beans.  Would jack fruit in water work for the beef?  I wasn’t sure if it wouldn’t be the right fit for what you were going for in flavor/texture/etc of the recipe. Thank  you.

I made this tonight (veggie version) and it was delicious. So flavorful and filling. I cooked the lentils in the broth for an additional 10 or so minutes. I added a few mushrooms since I had them. Super quick to pull together and had most ingredients on hand. I didn’t feel like I needed a side salad with the kale. LOL Thanks for another killer recipe. This is a keeper.
