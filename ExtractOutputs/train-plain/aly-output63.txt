8-Minute Sweet Potatoes



When you want sweet potatoes and you want them fast, this is how to do it!
Not only is this method quick, but it produces perfectly tender sweet potatoes with a slightly caramelized edge — as if you had roasted them in the oven. Swoon!
Plus, this version requires only 1 pan, 2 ingredients, and 8 minutes to prepare (because who has time for roasting some days?). Let’s do this!



It starts with slicing the sweet potato slightly less than 1/4 inch thick. The more even the slices, the more evenly they will cook.

Then add to a hot greased skillet (we prefer cast iron) and cover with a lid. Covering them allows the potatoes to soften from the steam, which accelerates the cooking process. 
That’s the beauty of this method: They’re steaming and browning at the same time!
Once golden brown on the underside, flip and repeat until they are fork tender and browned on both sides. It’s really that simple.

We hope you LOVE these sweet potatoes! They’re:

These sweet potatoes are delicious on their own, as a side dish drizzled with tahini and parsley, or in a breakfast bowl (recipe coming soon!).

					Gluten-Free, Vegan

Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


1
large
organic sweet potato or garnet yam


2
tsp
avocado oil


1
pinch
sea salt
(optional)




FOR SERVING optional


Tahini


Parsley





Instructions



Slice sweet potatoes slightly less than 1/4 inch thick and leave the skin on.


Heat a large skillet (we prefer cast iron) over medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce heat to medium and add oil to pan. Swirl to coat.


Add sweet potatoes in an even layer, sprinkle with salt (optional), and cover. Cook for about 3-4 minutes or until the underside is golden brown. Then flip and cover again. Reduce heat slightly if cooking too quickly. Cook for about 3 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are golden brown on both sides and fork tender.


Enjoy as is! We love these as part of breakfast bowls, with hummus, or just drizzled with tahini!


Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Not freezer friendly. Reheat on the stovetop over medium heat for best results.

I made these for the second time tonight, and they are delicious-even cold as leftovers right from the fridge.
I just used this method on some lotus root tonight, and it turned out great.
I’m wondering if you have or would consider doing a recipe using lotus root? I’ve recently started using it in stir fry’s and baked as “chips”, but would love to see what you could come up with!

We’re so glad you enjoyed it, Eden! We haven’t experimented with lotus root as it can be a challenging to find. But we will add it to our ideas list.

Made these last night, so easy and delicious! The only issue I had was the there was a lot of smoke coming from the pan even when I covered it. I didn’t have any avocado oil so I used olive oil instead, could that be the reason?

Hi Gigi, yes, that could definitely be the issue as olive oil has a lower smoke point. Next time, you may want to try reducing the temperature or using avocado oil. Hope that helps!

Tried this recipe in my Ninja Foodi with the grill setting. Done in 6 minutes without needing to turn thanks to the convection feature!  Crisp edges and evenly browned and tender.
Amazing. Delicious. And so nutritious.

I made these yesterday, they turned out tender, the avocado oil is excellent here, easy on the digestion, and I topped them with tahini and chopped fresh parsley. Love, love these tasty and tender sweet potatoes! Thank you!

Can I get a similar result if I don’t use the oil?

We haven’t tried it but yes I think so. I’m wondering if in your case steaming your potatoes might be best? Follow this method instead if it doesn’t work out.
