                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

Nothing says comfort like a roasted whole chicken, but it can take a while to cook. Using parts instead puts this easy roast chicken on the weeknight menu. Fresh herbs, lemon juice and capers in this Italian salsa verde sauce brighten things up. Source: EatingWell Magazine, March 2020

Ingredients



                                      Ingredient Checklist
                                  






                                                4 pounds bone-in chicken parts or one 4- to 5-pound whole chicken
                                            








                                                2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
                                            








                                                4 cloves garlic, minced, divided
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon kosher salt
                                            








                                                ¾ teaspoon ground pepper, divided
                                            








                                                2 pounds small carrots, halved lengthwise
                                            








                                                  1 cup chopped fresh herbs, such as basil, parsley, oregano and/or marjoram
                                            








                                                2 tablespoons lemon juice
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon capers, rinsed
                                            








                                                1 teaspoon anchovy paste
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon water
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Place 2 rimmed baking sheets in oven; preheat to 500 degrees F.

                                      Step 2
                                    



If using a whole chicken, cut into parts (breasts, leg quarters and wings). Cut any chicken breasts in half crosswise. Combine 1 tablespoon oil, half the garlic, salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl. Rub all over the chicken and under the skin.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Remove the pans from the oven and divide the chicken between them. Arrange carrots around the chicken on both pans.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees . Roast the chicken and carrots until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of a leg without touching bone registers 165 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes.







                                      Step 5
                                    



Meanwhile, combine herbs, lemon juice, capers, anchovy paste, the remaining garlic and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add water and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.







                                      Step 6
                                    



Serve the chicken and carrots with the sauce.
