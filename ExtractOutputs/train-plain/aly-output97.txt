Creamy Vegetable Risotto (30 Minutes!)

When we traveled to Portugal last year, we ate so much good food.
One of the dishes was a vegetable risotto the restaurant was able to make vegan-friendly by omitting the cheese and butter. Perhaps a cardinal sin in making risotto, but they obliged. One bite in and recipe inspiration was born.

This vegan, gluten-free, oil-free risotto is made with 8 ingredients in 30 minutes from start to finish!
It starts with fresh vegetables sautéed until just tender. We went with bell pepper, broccolini, and asparagus, but go with whatever is available and in season for you.
&amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;gt;

Next, start cooking the risotto by sautéing shallot and then adding arborio rice and white wine for flavor.
Once the wine cooks down, add warmed vegetable broth one ladle at a time and stir as it cooks until “al dente.” Then just add your vegan parmesan cheese and the sautéed vegetables and you’re good to go! It’s that easy.
A few things to keep in mind with risotto:

Always use warmed vegetable broth so it doesn’t halt the cooking when added to the rice.
Stir frequently as the rice cooks to prevent sticking.
Cook the rice at a simmer instead of a boil so the rice can cook slowly and evenly.
Cook until just “al dente” to avoid gummy risotto.


We hope you all LOVE this dish. It’s:
Creamy
“Cheesy”
Flavorful
Loaded with fresh vegetables
Easy to make
& So delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you need something that’s incredibly satisfying and comforting in a hurry. It would make a delicious entrée or side dish, and it would also work well for dinner parties, as it’s a versatile side dish that complements just about any main.

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
RISOTTO


3 1/2 - 4
cups
vegetable broth
(warmed on the stovetop // store-bought)


2
Tbsp
water
(or oil), divided


1
small
bundle asparagus
(ends trimmed or 1 small bundle broccolini, stalks trimmed (we used both))


1
medium
red bell pepper
(seeds + stem removed, thinly sliced)


~1/4
tsp
each sea salt and black pepper


3/4
cup
thinly sliced shallot


1
cup
arborio rice


1/4
cup
dry white wine
(or sub more vegetable broth)


1/4
cup
vegan parmesan cheese
(plus more for serving)




FOR SERVING optional


Fresh chopped parsley





Instructions



In a medium saucepan, heat vegetable broth over medium heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to low to keep warm.


In the meantime, heat a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, add half of the water (or oil) and the asparagus (and/or broccolini) and the red bell pepper. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and sauté until just tender and slightly browned - 3-4 minutes - stirring frequently. Cover to steam and speed cooking time. Remove from pan, uncover, and set aside.


Heat another large rimmed pan over medium heat. Once hot, add remaining water (or oil) and shallot. Sauté for 1-2 minutes or until softened and very slightly browned.


Add arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Then add dry white wine (or more vegetable broth) and stir gently. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.


Using a ladle, add warmed vegetable broth 1/2 cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring almost constantly, giving the risotto little breaks to come back to a simmer. The heat should be medium, and there should always be a slight simmer. You want the mixture to be cooking but not boiling or it will get gummy and cook too fast.


Continue to add vegetable broth 1 ladle at a time, stirring to incorporate, until the rice is "al dente" - cooked through but not mushy. This whole process should only take 15-20 minutes (may take longer if making a larger batch).


Once the rice is cooked through and al dente, remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Also add vegan parmesan cheese and most of the cooked vegetables, reserving a few for serving. Stir to coat (see photo).


Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding a pinch of salt and pepper to taste or more vegan parmesan to enhance the cheesiness.


To serve, divide between serving bowls and top with remaining vegetables, additional vegan parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle of parsley (optional).


Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. We haven't tried freezing this recipe.

Do you think adding miso into the broth would taste good? I’m looking forward to making this tonight for some neighbors! I’ve already sauteed up sweet potato, red cabbage, red pepper, broccoli, red onion, and caramelized some onions. I made your mushroom risotto for Valentine’s Day and it was a huge hit with my husband and my 5-year-old!

Hi Keely, that might be okay if you cook the orzo separately first and then add it in later in the cooking process. But they are quite different, so we aren’t certain it will turn out. Let us know if you give it a try!

This recipe is amazing!  I didn’t like the rice al dente so I covered it at the end for about 5-10 minutes. I also used vegan field roast cheese slices and used this time to let it melt in to the rice. So so good! Definitely give this recipe a try.

Risotto is one of my favorite foods, because it’s so versatile and it’s a great way to get your daily dose of veggies. I like that this one was simple to make and indeed CREAMY! I substituted more vegetable broth for wine, and it still turned out great.

This came out wonderful although I didn’t follow the directions exactly. I used Martha Stewart’s version of cooking the arborio rice. I sauteed the vegetables as instructed in a large  pan but I sauteed the shallots in a large pot rather than another wide rimmed pan, because I only had one large enough pan to accommodate all those vegetables and didn’t have another one for the rice. So I just cooked the rice like I normally would cook rice. Saved me so much time, and it still came out creamy. I sauteed the shallots as instructed but then poured 3 cups of mushroom broth, instead of vegetable broth, in the pan with the shallots, brought it to a boil, stirred once, covered it and let it sit for 20 minutes. So much easier than the incremental multi step process. Once it was done I just poured the whole thing into the vegetable skillet and mixed it all up. I didn’t do any of that reserving the vegetables and adding it on later. I also added more vegetables, like mushrooms, spinach, green peas, I deleted the bell pepper. I also added garlic. And I used real Parmesan cheese. Sprinkled with some parsley and added a bit of lemon juice. I thought it could have used more asparagus, like a pound’s worth, which, when when I make it again I will do. All in all it came out great. Definite keeper. Thanx for the recipe, Dana

Love this recipe, simple and delicious. I’ve made it quite a few time with all sorts of different veggies and to make it more flavorful without the vegan cheese, I add in garlic with the onions/shallots, and add a little turmeric, ginger, and cayenne to give it some spice.

This was my first attempt at risotto & was a family favorite! I subbed green beans for asparagus. Also I have tried a number of veggie broth options- my favorite is the Orrington Farms Vegan Broth base where you mix 2 tsp powder for each cup of water- it is favorful like chicken broth, but plant based. I also recommend using more than 4c broth for a creamy version!

I made this following the directions to the letter and it was absolutely perfect! My vegetarian daughter loved it, as did the carnivores in my family. For non-vegan vegetarians, I also made a batch throwing in 2 tablespoons of cream at the end, and using real Parmesan cheese. That was also delicious!! Loved it!!

Delicious! My husband, who is vegetarian, and I (who is not) both really enjoyed this dish. I added spinach to the vegetable mix, as I had a tub that needed to get eaten, in addition to the asparagus and peppers. The asparagus gave it a nice fresh crunch (and I love asparagus!), and the spinach added some extra green veges to the recipe, which is much appreciated after the decadence of Christmas! I used regular Parmesan, as neither of us are vegan, and it was delicious! Simple to make and a tasty change from pasta or other rice dishes (I’m not a very good vegetarian cook – I find it quite challenging). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe today and it was delicious!  I used both asparagus and broccoli, and Parmesan cheese. I t was great! next time I will add mushrooms. However, the 5 minute prep time was longer than that. I guess I’m not such a quick chopper. There is no way I can chop/slice vegetables that quick, and the cook time was longer too. Overall, probably at least 45 minutes. But definitely worth it!

Love it and so does everyone that has tried this. I sub in sweet onion for shallots. First time I made with broccoli and red pepper, used vegan “not-chicken” bouillon cubes for veg broth. Second time, I made baby bella mushrooms, peas and peppers (the peppers were completely unnecessary), I used vegan “not beef’ bouillon for veg broth.  Each was really, really good.  Made both oil free. Great recipe and for some reason, it’s fun to cook.  Thanks!!

I LOVE your recipes! I made this exactly as written, plus mushrooms. I used Pinot Grigio wine. It took me 1/2 hour to cook the rice, but I think my time is based on what I consider simmer.  This risotto is soooooo delicious! Thank you!

My first risotto attempt, and I was not disappointed – tasty, flavour-packed dish! Mine was not as creamy as pictured even with 4 cups broth, so may use a little more next time. Still an absolutely delicious meal!

I have never made risotto before, and this was way easier than I expected! I am not vegan so I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and the vegan Parmesan for actual cheese. Delicious!

Very good adaptation of traditional risotto, If I can add something, for who is up to using olive oil/vegan butter, the ‘soffritto’ with shallots (or onions) super finely chopped at the beginning + olive oil and / or vegan butter is one of the most important thing in making a real risotto. Also leave it rest (italian ‘mantecare’) for some minutes at the end, covered after having added some olive oil/vegan butter. 
I have to say best vegan risotto is with porcini mushrooms and butternut squash (the only one that makes me forget there is no real parmigiano!)

Peas and Mushrooms are wonderful in this recipe: The second time I made this dish, I used baby Bella mushrooms, peas and yellow/orange pepper. The pepper was not needed and the peas and ‘shrooms worked REALLY well. I don’t like veg broth (even homemade), so I use Vegan bouillon (Not Beed Cubes for the Mushroom and Pea version) and it was amazing. I made a large batch and took some to my neighbors and they loved it as well!

Very good. I’ve had this now both as the directions specify, and with basmati rice because I was in a pinch. To the basmati rice version I also added cauliflower, browned a bit. 
Great recipe. I will certainly return to it frequently.

As a former Natural foods chef I’ve made a version of this using short grain brown rice and it works wonderfully. Nuttier. Not a fan of Arborio because it lacks nutrients. Try it sometime and bravo on your continued success!

This recipe came out really good.  Cold and rainy day here so perfect for tonight’s dinner.  I used red onion instead of shallots and probably added too many asparagus (they are so good right now!) but everyone in the family liked it even though they have been ambivalent about risotto in the past.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Hi Mitch! The vegan parmesan is homemade (recipe linked above) so it’s not “fake” cheese. But if you’d rather, you can totally omit and just use nutritional yeast instead.

Dana, this recipe makes my heart happy. The past couple months I have had some really great risottos in restaraunts and was saddened at the complexity of the dish and that I could not make it at home. I cannot wait to try this! I have a question regarding the oil/water for sauteeing the vegetables/shallot. Which do you prefer? Will using one over the other alter the creamy yumminess of the risotto?

Well unfortunately i was out of arborio rice, so i cooked up a Costco quinoa/rice blend with veggie broth, and then cooked the veggies (dubbing more broccoli and some peas for the red peppers), as per the recipe, following all the other instructions for the vegan parm, etc. It was a hit!! I can’t wait to try it with the proper rice next time. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Risotto is made with arborio rice

G says 
March 28, 2018 at 12:23 pm 

Arborio rice is the classic rice for risotto because it is starchier than other rice and creates the creamy texture of the dish. If you use already cooked brown rice your dish would not be risotto and would not taste the same as this recipe. You’d essentially just have rice and vegetables, which is good, but not risotto.

This isn’t true. Risotto is a process. The rice you mentioned are great types of rice for getting results you want with these measurements.

Agreed. Risotto is a process of cooking. You can cook veggies and make a risotto or use other grains like barley and quinoa risotto.
