                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

This steak salad doesn't feature a typical dressing, but tangy kimchi, savory pan-fried shallots and lemon juice pack it with flavor. Forbidden rice helps add more color and nutrition to this tangy dish. Source: EatingWell Magazine, March 2020

                                                8 ounces hanger or boneless rib-eye steak, trimmed
                                            








                                                ¾ teaspoon salt, divided
                                            








                                                ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons water
                                            








                                                ½ cup forbidden rice or brown rice
                                            








                                                5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more to taste
                                            








                                                1 cup thinly sliced shallots
                                            








                                                2 cups sliced shiitake mushrooms
                                            








                                                4  scallions, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
                                            








                                                1  large ripe avocado, cubed
                                            








                                                ½ cup white kimchi (baek kimchi) or fresh sauerkraut, drained
                                            








                                                4 cups tatsoi, spinach or other tender greens
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon lemon juice
                                            








                                                ¼ cup toasted sunflower seeds
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Sprinkle steak with 1/4 teaspoon salt; set aside for 30 minutes or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

                                      Step 2
                                    



Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add rice, reduce heat to low, cover and cook until the water is just absorbed, about 30 minutes for forbidden rice or 40 minutes for brown rice. Stir in 1 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt and spread the rice on a baking sheet to cool.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Meanwhile, separate shallot slices into rings. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring often, until browned and crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to a plate; set aside.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Add mushrooms and 1/8 teaspoon salt to the pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add scallions and cook, stirring, until tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl.







                                      Step 5
                                    



Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan. Cook the steak, turning once and adjusting the heat as necessary, until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 135 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a clean cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into cubes.







                                      Step 6
                                    



Transfer the rice to the bowl with the vegetables and add avocado, kimchi (or sauerkraut) and the steak; gently mix to combine. Divide among 4 shallow bowls. Add greens to the large bowl and toss with lemon juice and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt. Top the rice mixture with the greens, the reserved shallots and sunflower seeds. Drizzle with more oil, if desired.
