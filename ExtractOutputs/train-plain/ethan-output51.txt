Key Lime Pie Cupcakes





		I bake over 200 of these cupcakes for our church suppers, and we always run out. If you can't find Key lime juice, use lime juice. Just add a tad more sugar. —Julie Herrera-Lemler, Rochester, Minnesota

Directions

Preheat oven to 350°. Line 32 muffin cups with foil liners. On a lightly floured work surface, unroll pastry sheets. Cut 32 circles with a floured 2-1/4-in. round cookie cutter (discard remaining pastry or save for another use). Press one pastry circle into each liner. Bake 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.   In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar until crumbly. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in lime juice. In another bowl, whisk flours; add to butter mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating well after each addition.   Pour batter into prepared cups. Bake 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.   In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, butter and vanilla until blended. Beat in enough confectioners' sugar, alternately with lime juice, to reach desired consistency. Frost cupcakes; top with raspberries. Refrigerate leftovers.



Editor's Note: As a substitute for 1-1/2 cups self-rising flour, place 2-1/4 teaspoons baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a measuring cup. Add all-purpose flour to measure 1 cup. Combine with an additional 1/2 cup all-purpose flour.Editor's NoteAs a substitute for 1-1/2 cups self-rising flour, place 2-1/4 teaspoons baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a measuring cup.

			I'm still not sure about using the pie crust at the bottom of the cupcakes, but they were very good otherwise.

			This amazing recipe is something that you must try in order to taste something unique and healthy. It is easy to read and I am sure it will be easy to cook as well. Thanks for posting.

			Excellent flavor and easy to make. I did have trouble also with the icing. I believe the recipe is a bit off with too much liquid to dry ratio. Making according to the recipe, the frosting was far too liquidy to frost but may have been okay for a pourable on a cake. I ended up adding well over 2 pounds of powdered sugar in order to get it to stand up to frosting consistency. Love the lime flavor though!

			These are the best cupcakes I have ever eaten in my life. I LOVE them. But no one in my family liked the crust though, so I leave that out. The reason I looked at these reviews was to see if others thought that these were dense. My husband wishes they were fluffier and more cupcake like (he still scarfs them down though), but I love them dense and wouldn't change a thing. They're almost more like a muffin. I was just wondering if I was doing something wrong. Also, these cupcakes burn very very easily so if you have not made these yet, watch them closely! When the edges start to slightly turn brown, they are done.

			I made these cupcakes for a brunch. I had several girlfriends coming over who expected delicious food and a decadent dessert. I then remembered setting aside this recipe for  a special occasion that would have everyone leaving happy. This wonderfully delicious cupcake filled that request. Thank you Julie, your directions were easy to follow and the finished product was beyond amazing!!

			I was looking for a cupcake that would taste light and fresh for an August (it Texas) wedding.  I came across this and thought it would just fit the bill.  I did make a few changes.  I loved the idea that it had a crust at the bottom, but if it were to taste like a "true" key lime pie, the crust had to be graham cracker crust.  I put 1 1/2 cups graham crackers in my mini food processor, pushed button 2 or 3 times, added 1/4 cup sugar (white or brown) and 5 TBS melted butter; mixed for about 20 seconds- done.  I used 1 tsp for the mini cupcakes and 1 TBS for regular cupcakes.  If you want it thicker add a little more.  I pressed with a gadget I have to shape pastry dough in a mini cup.  You can use your fingers.  Oven set for 350°.  For the mini cupcakes, I cooked the crust for 5 minutes - no longer!  Regular size cupcakes, I cooked for 7 minutes.  I took them out and let them cool completely before pouring the batter.  I made an error in the batter, but I think they turned out exceptional, so I will share my "mistake".  When I got to the alternately buttermilk and and flours, I did not have a 3/4 cup, so I did 1/4 cup buttermilk, then some flour, then I accidentally picked up the key lime juice which I had already added, and added another 1/4 c. key lime juice.  Well, all I could do is just add 1/4 cup more buttermilk and be done or it would have had too much liquid.  Well... the cooked up perfectly!  They were not too strong of key lime flavor but their was no doubt what time cupcakes they were.  I used the icing in the recipe.  It was delicious but a little too soft for decorating (for August), so I just added a 1/2 cup of some thick butter cream icing I keep in the fridge and it made it stiff enough to hold up to the Texas heat.  Everyone loved them.  Their favorite part was the graham cracker crust.  It was so pretty when it came out of the liner, like a little key lime pie.
