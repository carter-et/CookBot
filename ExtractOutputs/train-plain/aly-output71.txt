Grain-Free Burrito Bowls with Shredded Mexican Chicken


Now that you’ve tried our recipe for 1-Pan Mexican Shredded Chicken, let’s make dinner with it!
These grain-free burrito bowls have our hearts. They’re relatively quick and easy to make, require 10 ingredients you likely have on hand right now, and are incredibly satisfying and versatile.
Shall we?


How to Make a Burrito Bowl
You can make a burrito bowl literally however you want. But this is how we build ours:

Grain: White rice, brown rice, or cauliflower rice (Green Rice would be amazing, too!)
Protein: Shredded Mexican Chicken (omit and double up on beans if vegan / vegetarian)
Legume: Black beans (or, let’s be real, canned) simmered with sea salt and spices and slightly smashed for a “refried bean” effect
Veggies: Stir-fried peppers and onions + roasted sweet potatoes
Sauce: Fresh salsa (or, let’s be real, store-bought)
Guac: Our favorite garlicky guacamole
Garnish: Fresh cilantro

Bam. Dinner’s on the table fast.

For this grain-free bowl, we opt for cauliflower rice seasoned with simple spices, sea salt, and cooked until just tender.

Black beans simmer with spices and salt and are slightly smashed for a refried bean texture.

Peppers and onions are stir fried until just tender and slightly charred while sweet potatoes roast. And guac is smashed (and heavily sampled before dinner).

We hope you LOVE this burrito bowl! It’s:
Quick & easy to make
Customizable (switch up your veggies, proteins, and sauces!)
BIG on flavor
Satisfying yet not heavy
& utterly delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal when you want something that’s satisfying and wholesome on the table fast. It’s also great for a crowd of mixed eaters because it can cater to meat-eaters and vegans alike! Serve as a stand-alone meal or alongside some of these delicious Mexican-Inspired Dishes!
