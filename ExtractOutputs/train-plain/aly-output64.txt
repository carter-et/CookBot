Creamy Curried Cauliflower Lentil Soup (1 Pot!)



This soup is our last recipe of 2019! We couldn’t think of a better final dish to share than a comforting, warm hug in the form of creamy soup in the midst of winter.
This 1-pot soup is a blend of red lentils, ginger, spices, carrots, and cauliflower, making it full of fiber and plant-based protein and big on flavor. Let us show you how it’s done!



This soup starts with sautéing onion, garlic, ginger, and carrot. Then add cauliflower, broth, and lentils.

For spices, we kept things simple with fresh ginger, curry powder, and a pinch of cayenne, which complements the sweetness of the carrots beautifully. 

A touch of coconut milk before blending makes for the ultimate creamy texture. Swoon!

We hope you LOVE this soup! It’s:

This would make the perfect weeknight soup when you need something nourishing on the table fast. It’s delicious on its own, but would also pair well with our Apple Pecan Arugula Salad, Garlic Herb Flatbread (or Naan), or our Easy Marinated Grilled Chicken. 
Bonus: It reheats beautifully, making it ideal for leftovers, lunches, and freezer meals!

Cuisine:

					Gluten-Free, Vegan				


Freezer Friendly

					1 month				


Does it keep?

					3-4 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


2
tsp
avocado oil 
(or sub water for oil-free)


1
medium
white or yellow onion


2
medium
carrots, diced


1
stalk
celery, diced 
(optional)


1 ½
tsp
minced fresh ginger


2-3
cloves
garlic, minced


1
head
cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces 
(~4 cups as original recipe is written)


2-3
tsp
curry powder


1
pinch
cayenne
(optional)


4
cups
vegetable broth
(or sub chicken broth if not vegan or vegetarian)


1/2
cup
red lentils


1/2
tsp
sea salt, plus more to taste


2
Tbsp
coconut cream 
(or sub 1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk as the recipe is written // adjust amount if altering serving size)





Instructions



Heat a large pot (or Dutch oven) over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, carrots, and celery (optional) and sauté for 4-5 minutes — stirring occasionally. Then add ginger and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes more or until fragrant.


Add cauliflower, curry powder, cayenne (optional), broth, lentils, and salt. Bring to a low boil over medium heat and then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until lentils and cauliflower are tender.


Add coconut cream and blend with an immersion blender until creamy and no bits remain (if it has trouble blending, you can optionally transfer to a blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth). 


Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more curry powder for spice, cayenne for heat, or salt for overall flavor. Continue cooking for a few more minutes over medium heat.


Serve as is or with garnish of choice (we went with fresh cilantro and an additional swirl of coconut milk). Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month.

This has been my go-to recipe all winter.  I make it every week and the amount is perfect for two people with a few leftover meals.  The first time I made it I didn’t puree it. It was good, but even better once I used my immersion blender: smooth, creamy and richly flavored.  Instead of the coconut cream I use 1/2 can of full fat coconut milk.  I made it for my bookclub last night and they all loved it.

I made this for dinner tonight. I followed the recipe almost exactly, (using red lentils of course), but the soup was very YELLOW, not red like the picture! The only ingredient I omitted was the cayenne, which was listed as optional. Is that what makes it red? The soup in the picture looks much more enticing that mine did.

Hi Lin, sorry to hear it didn’t turn out as expected! The color can depend on the vegetable broth as well as the curry powder. We used a veggie broth that has tomato paste in it. Hope that helps!

Very good!  Added 2 parsnips since I had some, and used brown lentils, also what I had.  It made a lot!  Used 6 cups of chicken broth because I had  big head of cauliflower.  Added more salt and pepper, plus turmeric, for my taste.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow!

Delicious!  I used the celery because I love it and I shook a few shakes of cayenne.  It was not overwhelmingly hot, but left a nice burn on my lips.  Bravo, great recipe!  Oh, I did use chicken broth and added an extra cup, as it was rather thick.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband made this and we loved it. It is a keeper. He doubled it so we froze some.  We used low sodium / no sodium added vegetable broth and the coconut milk option. He doubled the ginger because we love it, and he also put spinach and a couple of broccoli crowns we had to use up. He blended half very smooth and the rest not as smooth so there were tiny chunks of the ginger. We also used some very hot smoked pepper powder we made this summer from our garden, it added a little kick if you like that. Yum! Thank MB!

This soup was so good! I added extra curry powder and extra coconut cream and the juice from one lemon. I didn’t have any broth so I just added some tomato paste to the water. I had leftover brown rice in the fridge and I threw that in, too. I only pureed half of the soup. It turned into a hearty meal!

Super easy and delicious!  Especially nice on a cold winter night, with crusty bread.  All ingredients are available at just about any grocery.  I put a little too much cayenne in for most people, but I really love spice!  Would make a wonderful 1st course of a nice dinner, too.  It’s a little more unusual than a lot of the soup courses I’ve seen.
Again, delish!  Try it!

This soup is so yummy! I made it last night, pretty much as the recipe called for (with slightly more lentils). I was actually surprised how flavourful it was! (Cauliflower can sometimes end up really bland). I blended 90% of it in my Vitamix and left the other 10% chunky. Soooo thick and delicious! Ate it for lunch with a little leftover basmati rice. Perfect winter meal!

This was SO good! I was a little worried as I was cooking it because cauliflower can smell not great to me while cooking. I had nothing to worry about, it was FANTASTIC! I mostly followed the recipe except I had to add more broth to cover all my cauliflower.  I also subed chipotle for the cayenne-something I always do, just my preference.  Thank you so much for yet another delicious recipe!!!

I used brown lentils instead of red so the color was a little drab, but once I served this, people ate it right up and only had good things to say.  I have to say, the flavor the first night of serving it did not pack a punch (in my opinion), but I let it sit in the fridge for 2 days, the flavor frew, and it was delicious. Super easy to make. I love that it was in one pot. I did not use coconut cream, but light coconut milk. I added sour cream to mine because the light coconut milk was not as creamy as I wanted it (this was the first night). I did not add anything to the soup when I had it for left overs.

I accidentally used thai curry paste instead of curry powder, so it had a very thai taste. It was still good. I added more coconut cream than the recipe calls for, and I didn’t have celery. I cooked this in an instant pot for 3 minutes with quick release. I added coconut cream after I cooked it so that it would not burn.

I’m not sure why, but perhaps the lentils were not the right type, but my soup came out looking green/yellow – not the beautiful orange in your pictures. The lentils were organic red lentils. I cooked some separately and they turned yellow. Can you please offer advice? Thank you.

This was yummy! I made it with almost twice the lentils, found it a little bland and ended up doubling the ginger, curry powder, salt, and coconut milk and adding a hit of Sriracha. It’s not a dinner party soup, it’s a winter sick day soup–warm, nourishing, and humble. I served it with cilantro and pepitas to dress it up a little. I would make this again for the right mood.

I am on a salt-restricted diet so used low salt veggie broth and just a pinch of salt. The soup is good and felt comforting on a cold Chicago New Years Eve but it needs more to replace the salt.  I’m no cook but wondered if turmeric might make it more flavorful? What else? I will make again for sure.

I made this tonight. I left out the celery and used extra carrots. I also added some cinnamon and garnished it with fresh parsley. The flavor is subtle but the soup was so comforting and warm. Great recipe.

I made it exactly as written, and it was very good. My family’s personal preference would be to leave the soup slightly chunky.

I have everything but the coconut cream or milk. Do you have any suggestions for replacing that? Cashew cheeze or almond milk?

Another non-dairy milk should work! Or it would probably even still be delicious without it. Let us know how it goes!

I made it and used a few cashews in the soup which blended well. OMG it was delicious!

This is amazing!  I just made it and served it to friends.  The flavor is out of this world.  Everyone had seconds. I followed the recipe but used three carrots to get a nice orange colored soup. It was more of a brownish orange, but it didn’t matter because the soup was so delicious.  Thank you for posting this as your last recipe of 2019!

This was great even though I only had 2c of veg broth and had to sub water for the rest! I omitted the cayenne so it wouldn’t be too spicy for the tiny human, and just added sriracha to mine for a bit of bite. Another easy and excellent recipe for grown ups that’s also 4-year old approved! Thanks!

I made this last night and it was the perfect soup to wrap up the year! Super easy and so comforting. I love how forgiving your recipes are; I’m terrible at exact measurements but they always turn out great anyways! Happy New Year to you and yours ❤️ Like many others I was thrilled to see you expand your recipes to include some meat and eggs this year. Can’t wait to see what next year brings :)

Was really excited when I saw this as had all the ingredients and sounds right up my street. Wasn’t my favourite. Colour was cream/beige and not the vibrant orange in the picture. Usually love all your recipes though! Will have a try with the next vegan one you post.

Hi Lindsay, sorry to hear this wasn’t what you were hoping for! The carrots provide it with a vibrant orange color- perhaps yours were more muted? Better luck with the next one!

I just made this for dinner tonight. I didn’t have the exact ingredients on hand so I used olive oil, organic Imagine Brand low sodium No-Chicken Broth (only 140 mg sodium per cup), light coconut milk, and red pepper flakes.  Then topped it with roasted pepitas and cilantro. It was very flavorful. Loved it & looking forward to left overs tomorrow. So easy to make!

Yummy, comforting, and cleansing after holiday food deviations ( love you chocolate, but you don’t make me feel good)!  I added 1/2 cup more celery and carrots.  Didn’t have cilantro, but topped with a little homemade pesto.  Thanks for your great 1-pot recipes and clear explanations!

What kind of pot are you using that you can use an immersion blender in without wrecking the surface? I’m on the hunt!

Hi Tracey, we used this Dutch oven. The blade of the immersion blender doesn’t touch the bottom of the pan so we didn’t have any issues.

823 mg of sodium is really high for a single meal.  How can you make this lower in sodium?

Hi Al, feel free to use a low sodium vegetable broth and reduce sea salt, if desired.
