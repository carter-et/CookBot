30-Minute Potato Cauliflower Red Lentil Curry


I’ve been counting down the days to share this curry with you all! It’s incredibly hearty, versatile, and is ready in just 30 minutes. Shall we?

This recipe came together on a whim one night when using up odds and ends from the week. I was hungry and needed something fast for dinner (hence the 30 minutes).
The first step is rinsing and cooking your red lentils, which I recommend doing in a separate pan. Red lentils cook really quickly (less than 10 minutes in my experience), and benefit from cooking separately versus in the pot with the rest of the curry.
While that’s happening, you’ll warm some whole spices like cumin, coriander, and mustard seed in a little coconut or avocado oil before adding shallot, ginger, garlic, and serrano pepper! For vegetables I went with cauliflower, potato, and bell pepper because that’s what I had on hand. But you can certainly sub similar vegetables according to what’s in season!

To make a saucy curry, I recommend blitzing a can of diced tomatoes (or grating a few whole tomatoes) into a loose sauce. This adds depth of flavor to the dish and makes it a little lighter than a curry that gets all its moisture from coconut milk.
Next comes a little vegetable broth for richness, coconut aminos for depth of flavor and umami, maple syrup for a touch of sweetness, and a little coconut milk to ensure a creamy texture.
﻿

Friends, I’ve been digging this curry so hard ever since we created it. We hope you love it, too! It’s:
Comforting
Quick
Hearty
Wholesome
Versatile
& Flavor-packed
This would make the perfect meal when you need something hearty and delicious on the table fast! The vegetables can be swapped out for whatever you have on hand. And you can play around with the tomato:coconut ratio for varied texture. Add more tomatoes or broth for a lighter curry or more coconut milk for a creamier, richer curry!
Into curries? We have so many! Try our 1-Pot Golden Curry Lentil Soup, 1-Pot Yellow Chickpea Cauliflower Curry, Rich Red Curry with Roasted Vegetables, 1-Pot Pumpkin Yellow Curry, or Sweet Potato Cauliflower Curry!
Pair any of these dishes with our Easy Vegan Naan, Spicy Mango Chutney, or Mixed Vegetable Pakoras for a comfort food feast!
