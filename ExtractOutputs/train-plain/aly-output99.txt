Easy Vegan Gluten-Free Pizza Crust

Friends, it’s here! A vegan, gluten-free pizza crust that’s easy to make with ingredients you probably have on hand right now. Not to mention, it’s perfectly crisp on the edges and firm but tender in the center. Whoop!
Let’s make gluten-free pizza dreams come true!

This recipe requires 10 simple ingredients and comes together in less than 45 minutes from start to finish!
The base flours are comprised of almond flour, potato starch, and arrowroot starch. Potato and arrowroot starch are particularly great for this recipe because they help make a firm and crispy-on-the-edges crust that’s also tender in the center.
No gooey center, no cardboard edges – just pure, airy, delicious goodness.


We also included some flaxseed for binding (and fiber), olive oil for moisture (which you can sub for water if oil-free), oregano and garlic for added flavor, and vinegar and baking soda to help the crust rise a bit.
Having tried a lot of gluten-free crusts (our own, at restaurants, and box mixes), we can confidently say this is the best gluten-free pizza crust we’ve tried and SPOT-ON in flavor and texture. Swoon!

Once your crust is formed, bake for 10 minutes. Then top with desired toppings. We went for tomato sauce, peppers, onions, mushrooms, kalamata olives, oregano, and whipped almond ricotta cheese. But you could go any way you prefer. I could see pesto working well here, as well as my butternut squash sauce!
Just a few more minutes in the oven and it’s officially pizza night!

I hope you all LOVE this crust! It’s:
Easy to make
Crisp on the edges
Tender (but firm) in the middle
Hearty enough to hold LOTS of toppings
& Insanely delicious!
For those of you in the vegan gluten-free camp, this is thee pizza crust for you. We couldn’t believe how fluffy, crispy, and tender it was all at the same time. Plus, not only is it delicious hot out of the oven, it’s also tasty as leftovers the next day – cold or hot!

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
CRUST


1 1/3
cup
almond flour
(not almond meal // I prefer Wellbee's brand)


1/2
cup
potato starch


1/2
cup
arrowroot starch


1
Tbsp
flaxseed meal


1
tsp
baking soda


1
tsp
oregano


1/2
tsp
garlic powder


1/2
tsp
sea salt


1
Tbsp
apple cider vinegar


1
Tbsp
olive oil
(if oil-free, try subbing water)


7-8
Tbsp
water
(add more as needed)




TOPPINGS (optional )


Easy Marinara
(or store-bought pizza sauce or puréed tomatoes)


Vegan Pesto


Sliced vegetables
(e.g. bell pepper, onion, mushroom, kalamata olives)


Whipped Almond Ricotta


Fresh basil


Red pepper flake


Vegan Parmesan Cheese


Sun-dried tomatoes





Instructions



Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet, pizza pan, or pizza stone with parchment paper. (You won't be cooking the pizza on the pan but rather on the parchment paper placed directly on the oven rack. So if you don't have a pizza pan, don't worry. You just need something to hold and transfer the pizza in and out of the oven.)


To a medium mixing bowl, add the almond flour, potato starch, arrowroot starch, flaxseed meal, baking soda, oregano, garlic powder, and sea salt and whisk thoroughly to combine.


In a separate small mixing bowl, combine the vinegar, olive oil, and water. Whisk to combine.


Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine until a dough forms (see photo). If it's too crumbly, add water until a moldable dough forms. If too wet, add more almond flour.


Transfer the dough to the parchment-lined pan or pizza stone and use your hands (or a floured rolling pin) to flatten and shape into a circle or square (the shape of your pan). It should be about 1/4-inch thick or less. It will puff up a little when baking. If the dough sticks to your hands, lightly oil to prevent sticking.


Transfer the crust to the oven by sliding the crust on the parchment paper onto a middle oven rack and bake for 10 minutes.


Remove the crust with the parchment paper and set it back on the pan or pizza stone. Top with desired sauce and toppings. We went for puréed tomatoes, onion, peppers, oregano, almond ricotta cheese, and kalamata olives (and added sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil after baking).


Bake for another 15-20 minutes or until the toppings are toasted and the crust is very slightly golden brown and firm to the touch.


Enjoy hot! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Enjoy cold, or reheat in a 375-degree oven (190 C) until hot.


To freeze: I would recommend par-baking the crust (completing the initial bake), then freezing on a baking sheet and storing in the freezer up to 6 weeks. Then, bake as instructed, adding a little extra cooking time if baked from frozen.

This crust is delicious! Just the right amount of soft and crunchy. I topped mine with the whipped almond ricotta (yum!), red bell peppers, red onions, slices of garlic-stuffed green olives, and my hubby’s marinara. It was quick and easy and I’ll definitely make it again.

This recipe is amazing! I’ve been a vegetarian since childhood, but have recently been trying to transition to an entirely plant-based diet. I made this pizza for my sister, whose been vegan for about ten years, and my father, who eats anything. The pizza was a huge hit with everyone! The crust is flavorful and bakes up to a nice bread-like texture. Not flat and cracker-like, as you get with some gluten free recipes. I added pizza sauce, the home made ricotta cheese recipe that you included the link for (also  got rave reviews in and of itself), mushrooms, bell peppers, red onions, and spinach. The only issue I had, and this may have something to do with the fact that we live at sea level, is that the dough was way too wet using the proportions of the recipe, as written. But I just added more almond flour until it was the texture I wanted. I also baked the pizza on a tray, because it didn’t seem stable enough in just parchment. But it turned out beautifully.

Absolutely amazing. The crust is perfectly crunchy and flavorful. I put so many veggies and the crust still held up, I was amazed. The almond ricotta is perfect and creamy. I did the same toppings (mushroom, green bell pepper, mushroom, red onion) and added some garlic and fresh basil on top! If you’re thinking about making it, do it. Not too much trouble either! Thank you so much for this recipe.

Hi Jamie, we haven’t tried that, so we aren’t completely sure. It may be okay to refrigerate, but the dough may not be quite as fluffy since the baking soda may lose some of its effectiveness. For best results, we would probably recommend par-baking it (doing the initial bake), and then freezing on a baking sheet and storing that way. Then bake as instructed, adding a little extra cooking time if baked from frozen. Let us know how it goes!

Hi! I am making the crusts this morning (larger party coming over so making several pizzas) for dinner tonight. Should I still freeze the crusts and then pull out this evening for the remainder? Or would you just put them in the refrigerator at that point? It’s about a 7 hour difference from when the crusts will be ready to when I am putting on the toppings. Thank you!

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
August 29, 2019 at 10:30 am 

The almond flour is pretty central to the texture. I’d say you’d be better off subbing a gluten-free flour blend or chickpea flour (if you’re OK with the flavor).

I am attempting to make this, but it is terribly liquify, even after adding 1/2 cup extra liquid. I substituted an egg for the flax seed and tapioca starch for potato starch. Perhaps that is the issue, but it states it takes 45 minutes and I’m not sure if the time is due to a lot of mixing/resting. Any suggestions?

Reply






Julie says 
June 15, 2019 at 4:24 pm 

Okay, so after adding a bit more dry ingredients I formed it with my hands and cooked it. It was really good! My guess is the egg threw it off a bit. I do plan to make it again and make it very thin!

Thanks Dana, I tried it with almond meal. It worked very well and was very filling. I was thinking how similar it is to garlic bread using the herbs and garlic powder. I’d be interested in somehow using it as a way to make vegan gluten free garlic bread from scratch. Do you have any suggestions?

I eat gluten because I am not allergic to it but this crust was so good with out it. It is SO easy to make! I bought marinara sauce to save me time, cut fresh veggies, and the Ricotta Cheese is a MUST! Thank you minimalist baker for always inspiring me to cook. I absolutely love cooking plant based and am a foodie so I had to share my experience since I appreciate all the honest feedback. <3

Hi! I really have been on a pizza kick lately so want to make my own to be healthier. Can I sub the almond flour completely with garbanzo flour? I like to reserve my almonds for desserts and granola and this swap is more cost effective for me.
I know there is a pizza recipe here with mostly garbanzo flour, but I really like the sturdiness and heartiness of this pizza. I’m trying to figure out a way to combine them because I want a pizza with toppings such as these. Unless you think the Socca Pizza recipe is sturdy enough on its own? I wanna sauce it rather than dollop (like shown in the video). It just looked a tad tender and delicate for what I’m currently seeking so I think the starches here would help.
Thank you!

Wow! Thank you so much for this recipe. Absolutely amazing crust. I have IBS and follow the low FODMAP diet, so I’ve been looking for a recipe that would work well for my sensitive and cranky tummy! I omitted the garlic powder (cannot digest garlic in any form) and used truffle-infused olive oil for some extra flavor! Also ran out of arrowroot partway through so I used some tapioca starch as well.  I topped with homemade tomato sauce and Tofutti Ricotta. So so delicious and look forward to eating this as leftovers tomorrow!

I substituted GF oat flour for the potato starch because I didn’t have any. I wouldn’t say it tasted like your traditional pizza crust (probably would be more traditional-tasting/fluffy with the potato starch, though), but I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I am pregnant and also allergic to everything and this is all I want to eat all day long. I’ve made it twice in the last five days. It’s nutty and yummy and I love it. Topped with roasted eggplant, sauteed onions/green peppers/mushroom, and a roasted red pepper sauce because I’m allergic to tomatoes. Thanks for existing, Dana!

I freaking love this recipe, man. I’ve made it several times, and the crust is absolutely perfect – crispy yet tender, and flavorful. Stands up to any toppings i toss st it. And who doesn’t love pizza?? 
I’ve discovered a crust-spreading timesaver: Instead of dumping the lump of dough in the center of the parchment paper, I spoon it out, sort of as if I am making drop cookies. Then just connect the “cookies” to make a crust. Viola!

I made this last night. I loved it. Super fast and easy. I have made other gluten free, vegan crusts and this is so far the best. The popular cauliflower crust takes forever and other versions require too much advance prep. I substituted additional potato starch for the arrowroot starch and used coconut oil instead of olive. I also omitted the vinegar as I don’t use it.  It worked.
Pros: Super fast for last minute supper
          Easy to form a workable “dough” and easy to press or roll out
          Makes a crispy crust that really (really!) holds it’s shape
          I liked the taste (crumbly like an almond biscuit, not doughy like pizza dough)
Cons:  Some people might not like the consistency or flavor if looking for a real pizza
          dough feel. Tastes a bit like almond biscotti with a shortbread cookie
          consistency.
Ideas for next time: (Oh, there will be a next time!)
          This time I hand pressed it to 1/4inch thickness. I got a good size, 2-person pie.
          Next time I will roll it out thinner between two sheets of parchment. The crust
          flavor wont take over the pie and I will get twice the surface area. It is a strong
          crust and will really give a super thin crispy pizza feel.
          I will season the crust with additional herbs, parsley and thyme for a little
          extra tastebud appeal.
Thank you for this Godsend!!!  Now I won’t dread pizza night!

I have been making this crust about every other week (I know…!) since it was posted a few months ago. I love it’s simplicity – it reminds me of the simple mills gf crust in terms of ingredients and texture. However, it hurts my stomach quite a bit. There aren’t many filler flours in this crust in comparison to many other gf crusts I’ve tried. I knew it was the flax seed so I eliminated it and the texture of the crust really goes down hill and leftovers are basically cardboard. But! I substituted an EGG for the flax and it totally changed the texture of the crust and it’s great. Not to mention leftovers really hold up. The texture takes on a more doughy texture. I realize not everyone can eat egg or chooses not to, but if you can/want to and flax hurts your stomach, too, try adding 1 egg instead of flax (keep everything else the same). Game changer.

I made your recipe without modifications a couple weeks ago. But I was craving it again this past week and didn’t have arrowroot on hand, so I tried tapioca as suggested as a possible sub previously. It came out great! I’ll still stick to arrowroot when I have it but I wanted to comment to let others know that tapioca worked for me.
Also! The whole pizza is 4 servings for me, so second time ’round I made 2 smaller pizzas. One crust, I parbaked and froze. The other, I cooked up and had half hot and half the next day cold. It was great all the ways.

I have made this twice and it is AMAZING.  Also note that I live in Hawaii, and it works just fine in our tropical climate.  My kids love it.  I doubled the recipe and made two crusts, kind of want to make it for a third time in one week :)

This is a fabulous (& forgiving) recipe!!! My daughter inadvertently quadrupled the quantities so we had enough for dinner, leftovers & a par-baked crust to freeze. Yay! I baked crusts on parchment on a preheated pizza stone and the suggested times worked perfectly. Thank you so much!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was amazing! I didn’t bake it straight on the rack but rather on a pan with a silicone mat and it still came out crispy! The dough itself smells so good and is so easy to put together. My picky boyfriend said he liked it better than dominos, so it’s a big win in my book!

I made this dough almost exactly as stated and it turned out great. I will admit that I may have left the dough a littler thicker than 1/4 an inch but not by much and I broiled on high for the last 4 minutes. I also ran out of parchment paper so I cooked it on a sheet pan. This dough is rich and will definitely fill you up. It’s tasty, crisp on the edges and tender on the inside. I put store bought marinara on top with onions, peppers, kalmata olives and mushrooms. I topped with salt, evoo and yeast seasoning. My dad (who eats only junk food) and my husband (not gluten free) loved this and so did I! Will definitely make again; it was so easy! Thanks for this!

This crust was amazing when I made it today! This is by far the best gluten free pizza crust I’ve had! The fact that it is vegan makes it even more impressive! My skill with dough is pretty lacking but I was even able to get a pretty close to perfect result the first time. My dough was very sticky, so it sounds like oiling it would be helpful. Thank you so much for this (and all the other) amazing recipe!

I’ve been making the same vegan GF pizza crust for years but decided to try this because it looked easy and because I’ve had success with so many recipes on this site. After the initial bake I knew I could never pass this off as pizza crust to my kids, so chose not to make it into a pizza. It’s more of a nutty, crumbly, biscuit-y flatbread. Tastes okay but not like traditional pizza crust at all. Will enjoy it as bread to accompany soup.

For the most part I liked this. It turned out perfectly crispy. I had to use one cup corn starch and a little bit of cornmeal. My husband said it was too nutty and overpowering though. I think with a better pizza sauce and toppings like sundried tomatoes it would have matched better than what I used (spinach and mushrooms).

Oh My Goodness!  I can’t wait to make it again.  Dana, thanks for giving us a recipe that is easy and crowd-pleasing.  This will, for-sure, be put into our regular rotation of recipes.  :)

Hi Dana!
Thanks for the recipe. But in ingredients, you say “almond flour not almond meal”. What’s the difference?

Reply






Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
March 16, 2018 at 8:05 am 

Almond flour is made from blanched almonds with the skin removed. Almond meal is made from whole raw ground almonds. The almond flour yields a fluffier texture and more delicate flavor.

Thank you, Dana!  When I posted my question, I was thinking for some reason that all we needed of the starches was 1/2 tsp, not 1/2 cup.  Measurement makes a difference… ;) 
Made this yesterday and it worked nicely – it felt almost like a yeasted dough.  I used oat flour in place of almond; potato flour in place of starch; and tapioca flour in place of arrowroot starch.  (I already had the potato and tapioca flours on hand.)  It took 16 or 17 tbsp of water, but I think different flours are more thirsty than others.

I think that would work! I would probably recommend par-baking it (doing the initial bake), and then freezing on a baking sheet and storing that way. Then bake as instructed, adding a little extra cooking time if baked from frozen.

Like the looks of this recipe.  However, I would like to make my own almond flour.  Have a vitamix that I use to make flour out of grain kernels. Would this work for this recipe to grind the almonds?  Also, I have never used potatoe starch.  What brand do you use?  Thank you.  Love your blog

I make my own hazelnut flour by blending the raw nuts in the blender till they  are fine and then perhaps put them through a sieve but i do not mind them a bit grainy. Just use small amounts so the pieces fly around right on top speed. That is my experience also with cashews and other nuts.

Grinding almonds will make almond butter. I learned this the hard way when I nearly ruined my grain mill. (I’d dried the almonds also.) Didn’t work. Just got embarrassed.?

Maybe it wouldn’t be as fine in the Vitamix as my mistake with the grain mill-I’d be interested if it works. I think there is too much moisture though.

Love this recipe!
I make my own almond flour by first making almond milk. Soak a half cup of  raw almonds overnight and slip off the skins. I use the tall unit of a Nutribullet to grind the soaked almonds with purified water up to the max fill line then strain out the pulp with a nut milk bag. Crumble out the remaining pulp after squeezing out the milk onto a dehydrator fruit roll sheet and dehydrate till dry. Then grind to a fine flour in the small unit of the Nutribullet et volia almond flour!

I use the vita mix with the ssd’s special grain/nut mill blender you can order from them. It works awesome. You can also do with the standard blender just do short pulses repeatedly, allowing the notes to settle in between pulses, and dont over do it. There’s a fine line between flour and nut butter.

This recipe looks delicious. My son is potato and rice intolerant and I’m gluten intolerant. This makes it complicated, as you can imagine. I’ve recently discovered almond flour and I love the added flavor it brings. I find much of the gluten free products to be so pasty. Anyway, in your experience can you recommend another starch besides potato that might work? Corn? Tapioca?  I’m reluctant to experiment for fear of wasting good food so I like to rely on other people‘s experiments whenever possible. : )
