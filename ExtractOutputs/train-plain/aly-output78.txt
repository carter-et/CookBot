Kale Falafel Hummus Wraps (30 Minutes!)


If you couldn’t already tell, falafel is one of our absolute favorite Mediterranean dishes (see exhibits A, B, C, D, and E).
And although these falafel are amazing on their own, adding them to pita wraps with hummus and greens brings them to the next level. Plus, they’re incredibly simple to make — coming together in just 30 minutes.

The falafel are packed with flavor (hello, garlic and cumin!), loaded with fiber and protein from chickpeas and oat flour, and have plenty of green vibes from fresh kale! The result is a quick-and-easy, delicious falafel that’s secretly good for you.

This recipe is made using a food processor, and once the falafel is formed into patties, it’s ready for cooking!
Unlike traditional falafel, which is deep-fried, this version is lightly fried in a skillet until gently browned on both sides. The result is a crispy outside and tender (not dry) center. Serious yum.

In a matter of minutes, it’s time to assemble your wraps. We like to use pita bread for the wrap, lettuce for greens, and hummus for extra flavor.
But the possibilities are endless…think Vegan Tzatziki, 3-Ingredient Tahini Sauce, or even Habanero Hot Sauce!

We hope you LOVE these falafel wraps. They’re:
Flavorful
Satisfying
Simple to make
Healthy
Versatile
& SO tasty
These wraps would make the perfect weeknight dinner or even picnic meal! Serve the falafel on their own, or pair with our Grain-Free Tabbouleh Salad or Simple Baba Ganoush for extra veggies. Mediterranean-inspired Mondays anyone?

Kale Falafel Hummus Wraps

Made with kale and chickpeas, these falafel are a healthier take on one of our favorite Mediterranean dishes. Delicious, satisfying, and only 30 minutes to prepare. Serve on greens or wrapped in chard or pita. 


Author: Minimalist Baker





Prep Time 15 minutes 

Cook Time 15 minutes 

Total Time 30 minutes 



Servings: 4 (Wraps)


Category:

					Entree				


Cuisine:

					Gluten-Free, Mediterranean-Inspired, Vegan				


Freezer Friendly

					1 Month (falafel only)				


Does it keep?

					3-4 Days (components stored separately)				


Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 


4
cups
loosely packed kale, stems removed and torn


4
large
cloves garlic, skins removed 
(4 large cloves yield ~2 Tbsp or 12 g)


1
15-ounce
can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 
(~1 ½ cups as recipe is written)


1 ½
Tbsp
tahini


3
Tbsp
fresh lemon juice


1/2
tsp
ground cumin


1/2
tsp
sea salt


1/4-1/2
cup
oat flour 
(ground from rolled oats // or all purpose if not gluten free)


2-4
Tbsp
avocado or olive oil 
(for cooking)




FOR SERVING


Hummus
(or store-bought // for topping)


4
medium
pitas 
(white or wheat // sub rainbow chard for gluten-free option)*


Greens of choice 
(such as fresh parsley or lettuce)





Instructions



Add kale and garlic to a food processor and pulse to chop into small bits. Then add chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, and salt and pulse to combine. Mixture shouldn’t be puréed, just combined.


Once incorporated, transfer mixture to a medium mixing bowl (or stir directly in food processor) and introduce 1/4 cup oat flour (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add oat flour another 1 Tbsp (5.6 g) at a time until the mixture is thick enough to handle — adding roughly 2-4 Tbsp.


Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. I added a touch more salt, cumin, and lemon juice. Scoop out heaping 2-Tbsp portions of falafel dough and use your hands to form them into approximately 1/2-inch thick patties. As written, recipe makes ~9 falafel.


NOTE: If not cooking all of the falafel right away, FREEZE uncooked falafel between layers of parchment paper and store in a container in the freezer up to 1 month. Then just thaw and cook as instructed!


Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp oil (or lesser end of range if adjusting batch size). Swirl to coat pan. Add 4 falafel (or however many will fit comfortably) to the pan at a time.


Cook until browned on the bottom, checking at the 2-minute mark to ensure they’re not over-browning. If they are, slightly reduce heat. Flip once they're deep golden brown — about 3-4 minutes. Cook until the other side is golden brown as well.


To assemble, lay pita (or chard) flat, top with 2-3 falafel, a healthy spread of hummus, and greens or herbs, and roll up. Secure with a toothpick or wrap with parchment or foil for easy handling. Store leftover falafel covered in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days and reheat in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven. See freezing instructions in step 4. 






 

Notes
*To keep this recipe gluten-free, ensure your oat flour is gluten-free and serve your falafel over a salad or wrap in rainbow chard instead of pita. *Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with lesser amount of oat flour and avocado oil and 2 Tbsp hummus, one medium-sized whole wheat pita, and 1 cup mixed greens per wrap.

Thank you for this recipe! I just made (and devoured) this recipe tonight and loved it so much I felt inspired to review. This meal is satisfying and nutritious without lacking flavor. I am always on the hunt for new healthy meals, but when my partner hears “vegan” he is instantly skeptical. THIS meal, however, is the second from the Minimalist Baker that has gotten a “favorite” review from both of us. (The one-pot shakshuka is a meal I make regularly). Another PLUS is how quick it came together after a long day at work. Thank you and keep sharing your wonderful meals!

I made the kale falafel and put it on a salad for my lunch and it was so good! I’m gluten free and dairy free, and I’ve struggled to find some good lunches that actually keep me full (and taste delicious) for my long afternoons. I just chopped up some veggies with some mixed greens and put 3-4 of the falafels on top and it kept me full and satisfied for the next few hours! Thank you for making such delicious recipes; I will continue to make this.

Best falafel I had! I couldn’t believe how perfect it was, made so fast and not even with soaked chickpeas. I’ve done it several times and it is failproof. YUM!
I substituted parsley for kale.

Amazing! I’ve made twice in 2 weeks. I added an egg the 2nd time and it helped bind/fry a little better. I also top w sea salt flakes when they’re still hot. I made a side of Baba Ganoush and quick salad to go with them. Delish!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I substituted spinach for kale and added toasted pine nuts. If I make it again, I’m going to add bread crumbs and flour as my first batch was extra watery, I’m not sure if it was because of the spinach substitute or not. I’m not super comfortable with my particular food processor, but the recipe came out very nicely and it’s definitely going to be a make again in my household!

Hi Jessica, yes, the spinach is likely the difference as it has a higher water content than kale. If this happens again next time, you can also add additional oat flour to compensate. Hope that helps!

Definitely a five for ease of prep and cooking! Can help to put mixture in fridge for falafels to hold shape, especially if omitting or using limited oat flour. Tasty flavor and also was able to successfully sub apple cider vinegar for lemon juice (used half as much) when I was out of lemons once!

My first ever falafel attempt — and turned out absolutely amazing! I made two tweaks:
1. Subbed tahini with almond butter;
2. Subbed a can of chickpeas with 50/50 chickpeas/bean medley mixture. 
They were so firm and nicely held together while frying! And of course, very tasty. I served it with a quinoa salad. This is gonna be my staple from now on!

I really enjoyed the falafels, the only thing I did different was add more oat flour to help with the stickiness and baked them. Oh, and added fennel seed. Next time will double the recipe and freeze some.

Just made this – pretty easy, and really tasty! Only change I’d make next time is figuring out a way to better cook them through. The top is crispy but the inside was still a bit uncooked. Full of flavor and really nice addition to dinner!

Support @ Minimalist Baker says 
July 15, 2019 at 7:31 am 

Hi Claire, so glad you enjoyed these! One idea is to reduce the heat slightly and cook longer on each side. Alternatively, you could start by frying and then transfer to the oven to finish. Hope that helps!

I love falafels but I’m sure they aren’t very healthy when you order them in a restaurant.  I made this recipe and put them on a salad.  It was a very quick and easy recipe which I like.  Will definitely be making again.

For leftovers, do you think it is better to cook, save, and reheat the falafel, or to save the mixture in the fridge (or in pre-formed patties in the freezer) and cook on demand?

Reply






Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
June 26, 2019 at 2:23 am 

I personally go ahead and cook them, then freeze. But if leaving them raw, form into patties, then freeze, then cook from there!

Hi Dana,
Oh my gosh, I’m just about to make these so obviously I’m coming on here late for answers! I absolutely hate tahini, can I sub Almond Butter? I’m guessing yes but I wanted to know if you thought that would be good. 
Thanks,

I made these and they tasted great but they didn’t hold together well for me during cooking. I cooked them in corn oil in a skillet. Could it be that the skillet was too wide, so the oil wasn’t deep enough? How deep should the oil be?
My kids actually liked them so I’ll definitely make them again but I might either bake it like a casserole or stirfry the mixture because we all loved the crispy bits. 
I served them with a dressing I made out of tahini, ACV, and soy sauce, that was to die for. Thanks for another awesome recipe!

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

They don’t need much oil for cooking. I wonder if they needed to just be stirred / blended a little better? You can try baking them! Use this recipe as a reference.

These came out excellent! Made them exactly as the recipe described. I may have pulsed the ingredients a bit much, so I had to add a tiny bit more oat flour to make them more manageable. 5 stars!

Great recipe, I did add 1/2 tsp more cumin, pinch more salt and additional tablespoon of lemon juice for my personal taste. I had leftovers for a couple of days and reheated in the air fryer and the texture was great. Leftovers sometimes are just disappointing after the initial recipe is so good but these in the air fryer were really tasty, nice texture on the outside and not dry on the inside.

Tried these tonight and really loved the flavor! 
I was able to form the balls with my hands, but had a bit of a binding problem during cooking. I put in a 1/4 cup flour (almond instead of oat) and then added 2 more teaspoons (though I reread the recipe and saw it said tablespoons. Oops!). I’m wondering if I needed to add a bit more flour or if it was more likely cook time (they had browned on the outside…about 3 minutes per side). I haven’t eaten falafel in a while and can’t remember how how moist/structured they are supposed to be. 
If you have any thoughts/feedback I appreciate it! :) Also, thanks for all your great recipes!

Falafel can be tricky to conquer. More than I’d like to admit, I’ve made recipes before that have failed, resulting in a crumbly sad mess. 
But this recipe changed EVERYTHING!
The falafel were perfectly cooked throughout and tasted better than my favorite food cart. The addition of kale really elevated the recipe. Bonus, it’s healthier by including more greens.  
I made 10 balls at roughly 50 grams each, fried in 2 tablespoons of olive oil for 3 minutes on each side. Served on pita with fresh diced tomato, spicy hummus, and a super green mix. I’m saving this one!
