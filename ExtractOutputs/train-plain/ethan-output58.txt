       Rusty Nail.   Image: Tim Nusog  




Bold and brown, the Rusty Nail is the kind of cocktail your grandfather might’ve sipped before dinner while leafing through “The Saturday Evening Post.” Invented in 1937 for the British Industries Fair trade show, the two-ingredient classic highlights Drambuie, a scotch-based liqueur flavored with honey, herbs and spices, the precise combination of which remains a closely guarded secret. What we do know is that the word Drambuie is derived from Gaelic, meaning "the drink that satisfies." The same could be said about the Rusty Nail itself.






































































Ingredients



1 1/2 oz Scotch


3/4 oz Drambuie








Steps





Add all ingredients into a rocks glass with ice and stir.
