                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

Use your air fryer to make these crispy, salty pickle chips for game day! The air fryer gives you a crispy crust, using much less oil than a traditional fryer. Enjoy these addictive little snacks on their own or with our Southern smoky, creamy dipping sauce. Source: EatingWell.com, January 2020

                                                ½ cup all-purpose flour
                                            








                                                2 large eggs, lightly beaten
                                            








                                                1 cup panko breadcrumbs
                                            








                                                1 (16 ounce) jar reduced-sodium dill pickle chips
                                            








                                                ¼ cup mayonnaise
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon Creole mustard
                                            








                                                1 teaspoon lemon juice
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Spread flour in a shallow bowl. Place eggs in a second shallow bowl and spread panko in a third bowl. Drain pickle chips and pat them very dry. Dredge the pickles in the flour, shaking off excess. Dip in the egg and then toss in the panko, lightly pressing to adhere. Working in 3 batches, place the pickles in the basket of an air fryer. Cook at 350 degrees F until golden brown, about 6 minutes.

Combine mayonnaise, Creole mustard, lemon juice and smoked paprika in a small bowl. Serve the dipping sauce with the pickles.

                                  One of the best things about these pickles is the dipping sauce -- it's also great on shrimp and fried okra.
