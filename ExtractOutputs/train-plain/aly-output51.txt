3-Ingredient Applesauce (No Sugar Added)



If you’ve never made your own applesauce, you’re missing out! It’s one of those foods that tastes better homemade than store-bought. 
Plus, it’s super simple to make! Our 3-ingredient applesauce requires just 25 minutes and 1 pan to prepare. And it’s made without any added sugar. Just apples, lemon, and cinnamon. Let’s do this!



How to Make Applesauce
We told you it’s easy, but “How easy?” you might ask!
Peel and chop apples. You don’t even need to peel them if that’s more your style!Add to a saucepan with cinnamon.Cook 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.Mash with a spoon or potato masher and add lemon juice.
That’s it!
Best Apples for Applesauce
We prefer applesauce that doesn’t need any sugar added. Honeycrisps (or other sweet varieties) work well for creating a naturally sweet sauce.
For a tart applesauce, you can choose Granny Smith apples instead.

We hope you LOVE this applesauce. It’s:Naturally sweetSuper simpleQuickVersatileGreat for freezing& SO delicious!
It’s incredible by the spoonful but would also pair well with coconut yogurt, vegan vanilla ice cream, coconut whipped cream, oats, waffles, pancakes (or vegan pancakes), and so much more! We think you could even use it as an alternative topping for our Caramel Apple Cheesecake Tart.

Recipes with Applesauce
Some of our vegan baking recipes use applesauce as an egg replacement. To use this homemade applesauce in such recipes, we recommend puréeing into a smoother texture.

Freezer Friendly

					1 month				


Does it keep?

					4-5 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


2
medium
honeycrisp apples, peeled, cored, and chopped in bite-size pieces
(sweet apples are best // for tart applesauce, use Granny Smith // organic when possible)


1/4
tsp
ground cinnamon
(plus more to taste)


1
tsp
lemon juice 
(for preserving / keeping fresh longer)





Instructions



To a medium saucepan add apples and cinnamon. Cover and cook over medium heat until it simmers, then reduce heat to low / medium-low and continue cooking until the apples are tender and very slightly caramelized — about 15-20 minutes. Stir occasionally. 


Once cooked, add lemon juice and stir. Then use the back of your spoon or a potato masher to mash into a loose sauce. You could also blend in a food processor for smoother texture (optional). 


Enjoy fresh, or store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. We enjoy it cold, but it could also be heated in the microwave or on the stovetop over low heat until hot.

Do you suppose this would work in the microwave?

Hmm, we aren’t sure! It would likely take quite a bit of time for them to fully soften. Let us know if you try it!

Yum! I love homemade applesauce. Chunky applesauce is especially good too. When I’m in a hurry though, I will core and chop my apples without peeling before cooking. Then I put the cooked apple sauce in my food mill – it takes out all the peels and leaves me with a smooth sauce great for baking recipes or whatever. Could also use an electric pressure cooker to reduce cooking time.

So, you don’t need to add any water or anything to the pan with the apples? They won’t burn or stick to the pan?
I’ve made applesauce before but have always added water, but this dilutes the flavour and the sweetness, so I am curious to try this.

We find that covering them with a lid produces enough steam to prevent sticking/burning. But perhaps if your apples are a variety with less moisture that could be more of an issue? Let us know if you try it!

This looks good and easy. I would put this in my Bendtec because I like smooth apple sauce.
