Roasted Squash Salad with Crispy Shallot & Balsamic Reduction


This may be one of my favorite salads to date! And that’s saying a lot considering we have heavy hitters like our Loaded Kale Salad and Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas (both of which are total home runs).
This seasonal salad relies on winter squash, my favorite 5-Minute Macadamia Nut Cheese, pepitas, and dried currants for ultimate flavor. And the 1-ingredient dressing? Yeah, it’s that easy (and utterly delicious). Let me show you how.

This salad comes together with 10 ingredients in 30 minutes!
It all starts with roasted acorn squash, which only takes about 10-15 minutes to roast. While that’s happening, start your balsamic reduction (which is simply balsamic vinegar reduced by half until you achieve a dreamy glaze).

Another amazing element to this salad is the crispy sautéed shallot. Simply slice shallot, toss in brown rice flour and salt, and sauté until crispy. It’s pure magic and you’ll never want to eat a salad again without these on top. I promise you.


We hope you love this salad! It’s:
Super flavorful
Fresh
Savory-sweet
Crunchy
Easy (+ quick!) to make
& So delicious
This would make the perfect side dish for the holidays! Or make it a main by adding our Actually Crispy Baked Chickpeas.

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
SQUASH


1
medium
acorn quash 
(or similar winter squash // pick one with green and orange skin)


1
Tbsp
avocado or olive oil


1
pinch
each salt and black pepper




DRESSING


1
cup
balsamic vinegar




SHALLOT


2
medium
shallots
(thinly sliced)


3
Tbsp
brown rice flour


1/8
tsp
each sea salt


~2
Tbsp
olive oil or avocado oil 
(for cooking - if avoiding oil, omit and use a non-stick pan)




SALAD


1/4
cup
macadamia nut cheese 
(or similar store-bought)


2
Tbsp
roasted or raw pepitas 
(we preferred roasted)


5-6
cups
arugula


2
Tbsp
dried currants 
(or other dried fruit, such as cranberries)





Instructions



Preheat oven to 425 F (218 C). To prepare squash, use a sharp knife to carefully cut in half lengthwise (from root to tip), then remove seeds with a spoon or ice scream scooper. Slice squash halves into even wedges and leave the skin on.


Arrange squash on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with oil, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Spread in an even layer.Roast squash for ~15-20 minutes or until tender and golden brown.


In the meantime, prepare dressing by adding balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil. Then allow to simmer until it is reduced by half and looks thick (about 10-15 minutes). Watch carefully near the end as it can go from reduced to burnt quickly. You’ll know it’s done when, swirled, it coats the sides of the pan.


At this time, prepare the nut cheese (link to recipe above), or if using store-bought, skip this step.


If toasting pepitas, add to a dry skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned - about 3-5 minutes (being careful not to burn).


Next, add sliced shallots to a small bowl with brown rice flour, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Heat a medium (preferably cast-iron) skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and floured shallots and sauté, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden brown and crispy - ~5 minutes.


To serve, arrange arugula on a platter or serving bowl and top with roasted squash, crispy shallots, dollops of macadamia nut cheese, pepitas, and cranberries or currants. Drizzle with dressing.


Best when fresh, but leftovers can be stored covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days (preferably without dressing and squash separate from greens).

This salad tasted incredible. It’s great to know what I’m eating not only tastes good, but is good for me! I used goat cheese, since that’s what I had on hand, dried blueberries and mixed spring greens. All around delicious. Looking forward to making it again and again :)

I didn’t want to buy brown rice flour just for this, so i used Arrowroot starch and it was off— the shallots didn’t crisp up. They got kind of stretchy and chewy. Still tasted alright but not as good had they been crisped up!

Hmm, I haven’t tried this with arrowroot, but would’ve guessed it’d have been fine. My best subs for brown rice flour are white rice flour or chickpea flour!

I loved this salad!  I substituted in dried cranberries, goat cheese, and added delicata squash cut on the cross section to make pretty flower shapes.  Also, I used Nonna Pia’s balsamic reduction instead of making my own, and added a thin drizzle of olive oil.  It was beautiful and delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

One of the tastiest salads I’ve ever had! Would be perfect for Thanksgiving as well. The only change I made was to use honey goat cheese and dried cranberries. My husband raved about it. I’ll slice my acorn squash thinner next time – got a huge one at the market and it was a bit cumbersome but still delicious. Thank you!

This salad almost seemed too simple that I wasn’t going to try it.  I’m glad I didn’t write it off though because it will now be on my rotation!  I made this salad using a butternut squash and my, OH MY was this delicious! I don’t know if I’ve been getting “bad” squashes or just not roasting them at the right temperature but this time the butternut squash got so candy-like and carmelized.  Then, the crispy shallots and crisp nuts. OOHHH! ? For anyone wondering, this is a pretty sweet but hearty salad.  My sister isn’t a fan of squashes and sweet salads but my parents and I both enjoyed the dish.

I didn’t made the recipe yet, it’s on my list!
But, scrolling through all the recipes, I find it difficult for me to find recipes without nightshades or just a specific type of recipes. It would be nice to classify the recipes better then super large categories. It would be faster and easier to find vegan-breakfast or nightshade-free dinner!
Keep the good work! :)

This was amazing.  The ONLY dish people went back for seconds at Thanksgiving dinner.  I did have a few leftovers with it all mixed together-dressing and squash-and had it for lunch the next day and it was magical.
Making it again for lunch tomorrow with some butternut squash for my après ski meal and wine.

This salad is beautiful and met some of my omnivore partner’s likes (arugula, dried berries, pepitas, basalmic reduction), but not all (squash is suspect).
This was amazing. I wasn’t sure as I brought it all together, my attempt at the shallots was lackluster and since we don’t do squash a lot I was worried that it wasn’t done enough. I cooked an extra 5 minutes as my slices were chunky.
It was amazing. Definitely going into the meal planning rotation. We both loved it.
Dana-you are amazing. Thank you.

The store didn’t have any squash (other than spaghetti) but I was DETERMINED to make this so used roasted cauliflower instead. Obviously changes the flavoring but was still SO delicious. However, I am (slightly) ruined because I now need crispy shallots on every salad going forward.

I made this for a work potluck and it was a huge success. Normally I would be turned off by squash with the rind still on, but it actually adds a nice texture. I was pressed for time so I subbed Kite Hill Ricotta for the macadamia nut cheese and it was dreamy. I’ll be making this again.

I made the macadamia cheese after soaking it for one hour in hot water; but my Cuisinart Food Processor made it slow; it took ten minutes and as you mentioned 1tbs more each time.  It is perfect; the squash I had used was already cut and frozen (organic); they are a little mushy but that is okay, it is for me only; I wanted greens and cranberry sauce; instead I got a salad that has dried cranberries, squash and argula; this is a wonderful way to eat well and enjoy the day.  I love your recipes thank you.

This recipe was way better then I expected it to be (and I was expecting it to be great)!! I make a lot of your recipes, but this is the first time I’ve commented. You come up with such wonderful recipes and I hope I can be as creative as you someday! 
I didn’t have a lemon for the cheese but it really needs it. I can still add it to the leftovers though. I was tempted to add sugar to the reduction because I wanted something thicker (and sweeter), but I didn’t for health reasons. I added some cornstarch and it thickened up beautifully.
When everything came together its was soooo good! Thanks!

This salad is a. maz. ing! So many beautiful flavors coming together make it a perfect fall salad. I am not vegan so I used crumbled feta for the cheese and it was delicious. I also substituted sweet potatoes for the squash. Really, really loved this. I immediately marked it as a favorite and will be making it again. Yum!!!

Hey Dana! I made this for a lunch birthday today. :) One question, “1/8 tsp each sea salt,” does that mean 1/8 per shallot, since you said “each?” I did just a 1/8, and that taste right, but just making sure for Thanksgiving! Looks amazing!

I made this and forgot the pepitas! Taste was amazing but I really missed that crunch. Next time I will remember! Love the balsamic reduction, I could actually eat that on it’s own. And the mac cheese was great! My first time making vegan cheese and it really wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be. I’m beginning to really love nutritional yeast.

I think you are missing some of the instructions on how to prepare the squash.  How thick are the slices?   Skin on?  Any hints on slicing?  If those are skin-on, gosh, that’s the thinnest skinned acorn squash I have ever seen!  I think it would take me the 10 minutes of prep just to get to the point of putting the squash in the oven.    I am going to try this with my excess of Sweet Dumpling squash, though – I don’t love squash by itself, but in a salad, that sounds great!  I’ll reduce the roasting time.
