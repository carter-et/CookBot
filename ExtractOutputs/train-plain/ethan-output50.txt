                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

Let this cute little vegetarian stuffed squash side dish steal the show at the dinner table! Butternut squash is stuffed with a sweet and savory filling that gets a crispy finish under the broiler. If you can't find small butternut squash, honeynut squash is a great alternative. Shaped much like a butternut squash (but smaller), the honeynut squash has a deep orange skin and sweet flesh.

Ingredients



                                      Ingredient Checklist
                                  






                                                2 small (about 1 lb. each) butternut squash or honeynut squash
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
                                            








                                                ½ teaspoon ground pepper, divided
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
                                            








                                                1 cup finely chopped onion
                                            








                                                1 cup finely chopped celery
                                            








                                                ¾ cup finely chopped Honeycrisp apple
                                            








                                                3 small cloves garlic, minced
                                            








                                                1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
                                            








                                                ¾ cup whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs
                                            








                                                ¼ cup chopped toasted pecans
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut squash in half lengthwise; scoop out and discard seeds and stringy pulp. Sprinkle the cavities with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Coat a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Place the squash halves cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roast until tender when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes.

                                      Step 2
                                    



Switch oven to broil. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, apple, garlic, sage and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in panko and pecans.







                                      Step 3
                                    



When the squash halves are cool enough to handle, gently scoop 2 to 3 tablespoons of flesh from each half, and coarsely chop. Add the chopped squash to the vegetable mixture, stirring to combine. Divide the vegetable mixture evenly among the squash cavities. Broil until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
