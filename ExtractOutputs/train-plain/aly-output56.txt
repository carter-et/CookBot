Healthier Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies (GF & 1 Bowl!)



Peanut butter cookies seem so effortless. Just throw peanut butter and some other random ingredients in your kitchen into a bowl, bake, and voila! — peanut butter cookies! Or so I thought.
This recipe was tested and retested and scrapped and tested again. It caused us so much trouble, but we’re happy to report we stuck with it and are so happy with the results.



Thanks to a little inspo from the talented Liz Moody, we finally got the perfect base formula right, and it’s butter- and oil-free!
The problem with our previous attempts was adding fat in addition to the peanut butter, or adding too many dry ingredients, or too many wet ingredients. Friends, it was touch and go. But this simple, unfussy, 1-bowl technique is perfection!

Simply stir dry ingredients: brown sugar, gluten-free flour, rolled oats, salt, and baking powder.
Then add wet ingredients: peanut butter, egg, vanilla. And stir again. Throw in some chocolate chips and you’re good to go! No chilling required!

This batter comes together in less than 10 minutes. Baking is just another 10 minutes. That means cookies that are ready in like 20 minutes!
Faster cookies = better cookies. It’s science.


We hope you LOVE these cookies! They’re:
Peanut butterySalty-sweetTender with a slight chewStudded with chocolate& Incredibly delicious
These would make the perfect treat to have on hand throughout the week. They also keep well in the freezer for when sweet cravings strike!

Healthier Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies (GF & 1 Bowl!)

Healthier 1-Bowl Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies made without butter or oil. Perfectly chewy, salty-sweet, and studded with chocolate chips! 


Author: Minimalist Baker





Prep Time 18 minutes 

Cook Time 12 minutes 

Total Time 30 minutes 



Servings: 12 (Cookies)


Category:

					Dessert				


Cuisine:

					Baking, Dairy-Free, Gluten-Free				


Freezer Friendly

					1 month				


Does it keep?

					4-5 Days				


Ingredients
US Customary – Metric 


1/4
cup
rolled oats
(ensure gluten-free friendly as needed)


1/4
cup
gluten-free flour 
(or sub other flour, such as almond or unbleached all-purpose)


1/4
tsp
sea salt 
(plus more for topping)


1/2
tsp
baking powder


1/2
cup
brown sugar 
(or try subbing coconut sugar, but we only tested with brown)


1/2
cup
creamy salted peanut butter 
(we like Wild Friends — ingredients should only be peanuts and salt)


1/2
tsp
vanilla extract


1
large
egg
(organic, pasture-raised when possible)


3
Tbsp
dark chocolate chips (dairy-free), chopped 
(plus more for topping)





Instructions



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.


To a medium mixing bowl, add gluten-free oats, gluten-free flour blend, sea salt, baking powder, and brown sugar and whisk to combine.


Add peanut butter (ensure it’s natural and pourable — just peanuts and salt), vanilla, and egg and stir until a tacky dough is formed. Depending on the freshness / drippiness of your peanut butter, you may need to add a little more GF flour if it’s too wet. Or, if it’s too dry or crumbly, compensate with a bit more peanut butter (or a splash of dairy-free milk). We found ours didn't need any adjustments.


Stir in chocolate chips. Then scoop out dough in 1 ½ Tbsp amounts (I like using this scoop) and place on prepared baking sheet. Top with another sprinkle of chocolate chips and press down slightly to form into a disc shape.


Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges appear slightly golden brown and they’ve expanded to about twice their original size. Remove from oven and let cool on pan for 10 minutes (top with another small sprinkle of salt at this time – optional). Then enjoy (preferably with dairy-free milk).


Store cookies well sealed at room temperature up to 4-5 days, in the refrigerator up to 1 week, or in the freezer up to 1 month (let thaw before enjoying).

These are dangerously easy to make and so so good! The perfect combo of sweet and salty, with a nice soft chewy texture from the oats.  Definitely one of the best (if not the best) gluten free cookies that I have ever had!

I made this last night  – 5/5. All devoured. Used almond flour. 
Going to make them again tonight but will reduce sugar to 1/3 cup as we found 1/2 cup sugar delicious but a bit too sweet. 
Thank you!

Just made these and YUM! My daughter is vegan so I used a little under a quarter cup of Just Egg instead of the egg in the recipe. And since I didn’t have any gluten free flour on hand, I just blended a quarter cup of the GF oats for the flour. They turned out delicious — I’m keeping this recipe for sure!

I made a vegan version by replacing the egg with 1/4 cup aquafaba and they turned out perfect! I also used 1/4 cup organic cane sugar instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar and they turned sweet enough. I’m glad I didn’t add any more sugar!
I’m wondering though if I could replace the sugar with real maple syrup so it’s more nutritious? Thanks.

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

Wonderful! Thanks for sharing. If you try subbing maple syrup you’ll likely need more dry ingredients to compensate a wetter texture. Let us know if you try it!

I made these yesterday! I substituted flax (1 tablespoon of flax meal plus 3 tablespoons of water) for the hen period. I also added 1 tablespoon of oat milk into the batter since mine seemed to be a bit dry. The cookies turned out delicious! Super peanut buttery and sweet! I will definitely make these again soon.

These turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly (had to warm up my PB as it stays in the fridge and thus was not creamy) and had no issues. It came together really quickly. I can tell this will be a new go-to cookie recipe for me in the future. It made 12 cookies exactly, so it’ll be easy to double if needed.
Another winning recipe, Dana and team!

So I made these last night and now I’m making them again. This time, though, I’m doubling the recipe because 4 of my kids inhaled the 12 cookies in like 3.2 nanoseconds… faster than kid #5 could get to them! These were super-easy and super-quick to make. The only change I made was using regular non-drippy peanut butter (Jif) because that’s all I had. They were perfect! Thank you, Dana, for yet another fantastic recipe!

What a great recipe, so easy and delicious! I usually have MB’s gluten free flour mix on hand but was out so used Bob’s Red Mill gluten free flour instead. I like crispier cookies so these stayed in the oven for an extra four minutes (I also live at a high altitude and that affects cooking time sometimes too). Just finished a second batch and saw in the recipe the addition of salt on top of the cookies when cooling…ran into the kitchen to sprinkle some Maldon sea salt flakes on the cooling cookies and am looking forward to tasting that special addition!

Appreciated the simplicity of the recipe. 
Adaptations (based on what was available to me): 1) No peanut butter so used almond butter instead; 2) No chocolate chips, so used equal amount cocoa powder; 3) No vanilla so omitted. Did not add more sea salt on top of each cookie. Used the Minimalist Baker GF flour and otherwise followed the recipe as is. Made in a single batch, and liked it so much, I made another – this time a double batch. 
Results:  Delivered the expected of servings. Tastes good despite the adaptations. Salty and sweet. Did not expand to double as recipe indicated, but didn’t make a difference to me.
Definitely keeping this one back pocket – thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the recipe, but it only made about 16-18 small cookies.  I also halved the sugar and used 50:50 coconut and brown sugar, which may have contributed the batch size.  Would make again!

Loved these. Mine came out a little flat. Probably because I used local organic oats which are very tender/soft and I used homemade peanut butter. I used white whole wheat flour.  The taste was amazing, so easy to make. I used Lily chocolate chips because I had them on hand, don’t really like them much, but they were good in these cookies! These were such a hit, I made a double batch for the freezer the next day.

Yummy. This is a keeper.
Different continent, different peanut butter, my cookies did not expend. I could probably press them a little more before baking then. But event with pressing them only a little, i like them a lot. Taste and look.
The peanut butter i used is actually 100% peanuts (no salt). The quantity of « fleur de sel » i used for the recipe still makes it perfectly balanced to my taste. Would not add more.
If I am not mistaken, you mention (in the ingredients) salt for in the dough and somehow on top.. but I did not see it mentioned in the recipe so was wondering if you suggest to add some salt on top of the cookies as well before baking.
Thanks a lot for the metric conversion too ! Made my life soooo much easier :-)

By the way (note to self) : love them with only 60 g of light muscovado sugar.

Just made these. I have to say the raw dough tasted darn good. The cookies were quite good, but rather crumbly. I used half gf flour and half almond flour.  I think next time I would put half the amount of sugar and wouldnt add in extra salt because I think the salt from the PB was enough. But definitely a good foundation and the flavour is there!

I have made these twice now. First time with double the recipe size of rolled oats & 1/4 Cup almond flour. I only had natural pb  without salt but found the 1/4 tsp in your regular recipe enough. Used coconut sugar instead of brown. Second time I made oat flour out of 1/2 the rolled oats and just used that with the rolled oats – same other substitutions as above. Each made about 20 small cookies and took about 14 mins to bake switching 2 cookie pans 1/2 way between top and bottom. Great reviews from family and friends each time. Thank you so much for your creative and easy recipes.

Hi, Judy! I haven’t tried these with an egg replacer. But if you try a chia egg, let us know how it goes! I’d probably recommend aquafaba instead. Check out this Guide to Egg Substitutes for details on these substitutes and more.

Hi Dana from BC, Canada
Like the recipe. Made tonight for a play rehearsal.
I used half and half garbanzo and coconut flours. Worked fine.
Used coconut sugar. Will use date sugar in the future as well.
Doubled  recipe and only made 22 small cookies.
Quality, not quantity, right?
Thanks for all you do.
I have your cookbook!
The coconut red curry veg soup recipe is fantastic!!! Sooo flavourful.
Will make repeatedly!!

This is probably the best PB cookie over ever tasted. I used almond flour, Aldi brand PB and mini chocolate chips. The taste and texture are fabulous. PB cookies are usually slightly greasy, they were not. Next time I’ll have to double the recipe since I have 3 boys and a hubby I have to share they with. I appreciate the notes making it customizable for you dietary needs. THANK YOU for your trial and error perfecting this cookie!

Could you replace the egg with a flax or chia egg to veganize this?  Or would you suggest any other egg alternatives?

I’d say 1/4 cup whipped aquafaba would be the best substitute. Similar to this recipe. Let us know if you try it!

If you sub aquafaba, do you have to whip it? Or can you use plain aquafaba straight out of the can? 
I don’t have an electric mixer :(.

You can certainly try it without whipping. I’d suggest whipping primarily to help them be more airy and rise. But let us know how it goes! I recommend (and personally use) a handheld electric mixer (which are usually quite affordable).

Hi there, these look delicious. What would happen if I skipped the sugar completely? Think it would still work?
Thank you!

Hi Heidi! I think you’d want some sweetness from somewhere. But texturally they should be fine. Just add more dry ingredients of choice to compensate for a drier texture.

Super good! I only had almond butter so used that instead and also used coconut sugar. I will be baking them again for sure!!

I had all the ingredients on hand so made it right away! I’ve never made/eaten GF cookie before so I didn’t know what to expect but it wasn’t quite traditional cookie-like. It almost tasted like just sugar and PB, and I wish there was little more flour/dough-y taste? Also it’s very sweet, so I might lessen the sugar next time and add more oats/GF flour maybe. Anyway, I recently went GF, so thank you for another easy recipe!

Thanks for sharing, Rita! You could always cut back on sugar and replace it with GF flour, as that will provide a more flour-y, less sweet texture/flavor!

I ould love to make thses but I have an intolerance for oats for reasons other than they contain gluten. Will it change the results much if I leave them out? Thanks!

I don’t think so. Just add more dry ingredients as needed to compensate for a wetter batter.

Can I use plain flour? I also have smooth almond butter – would that work. Trying to use my store cupboard, thanks

Hello: Thank you for all of the great recipes!
Re: these cookies, would almond (or another nut) butter work in place of peanut butter?

Just made these with regular all purpose flour. They tasted amazing.
Prep time was actually more of a 5 minute thing. 
Do you think these could be make with almond butter?

Have you tried this with an egg replacer like aquafaba or a flax egg to make it vegan? Do you have a recommendation for the best egg replacer for this recipe? Thanks!

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

I’d suggest aquafaba, but others have also had success with flax egg. Let us know what you try!

Yum! Can’t wait to try this. Do you reckon this would work with a flax egg as substitute?

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
January 30, 2020 at 12:12 pm 

Hmm, I’m not sure. It would definitely be a different texture. I’d almost recommend using aquafaba (~4 Tbsp) instead. Let us know if you give either a try!

Do you have to whip the aquafaba first? Thx and excuse my ignorance on that!!

In order to use Aquafaba to you have to whip it up to add to the recipe or just pour it in as is?

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

I would whip it, similar to this recipe.

I’d recommend trying aquafaba. But a banana or applesauce may work! Let us know if you give it a try as we haven’t tested any other substitutions.
