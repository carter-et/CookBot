                                                What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                              




                                                  
                                                  What's in Your Shamrock Shake?
                                                


                                                  Can you guess how many calories are in a Shamrock Shake? Don't let that green color fool you, these shakes are nowhere near green-smoothie status when it comes to nutrition and ingredients. Try our healthier recipe instead.

                                                1 ½ tablespoons white-wine vinegar
                                            








                                                ¾ teaspoon ground cumin
                                            








                                                ⅛ teaspoon salt
                                            
















                          Directions
                        


                                Instructions Checklist
                            






                                      Step 1
                                    



To prepare taameya: Drain fava beans. Combine cilantro, parsley, onion and garlic in a food processor. Process, scraping down the sides as necessary, until very finely chopped, about 1 minute. Add the fava beans and continue processing until a paste forms, about 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon coriander seeds and salt; process for 1 minute more.

                                      Step 2
                                    



Pound the remaining 6 tablespoons coriander seeds in a mortar and pestle until cracked. Stir in sesame seeds and transfer to a plate.







                                      Step 3
                                    



Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap.







                                      Step 4
                                    



Meanwhile, using 2 tablespoons each, form the fava bean mixture into 24 disks 1 1/2 inches wide. Lightly press both sides of the disks in the seed mixture and place on the prepared pan.







                                      Step 5
                                    



In batches, carefully drop the disks into the hot oil and cook, flipping once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer the taameya to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.







                                      Step 6
                                    



To prepare sauce: Whisk tahini, water, vinegar, cumin and salt in a small bowl. Serve the taameya with the sauce.







          Tips
                            



Tip: Look for "peeled" or "skinless" dried fava beans with other dried beans at well-stocked supermarkets or online at bobsredmill.com.To make ahead: Refrigerate sauce (Step 6) for up to 4 days.
