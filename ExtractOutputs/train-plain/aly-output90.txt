Socca Pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes & Pesto


Now that we’ve discovered how delicious socca is, let’s make pizza!

This recipe requires just 10 ingredients and 1 bowl to make and comes together in about 1 hour.
The reason I love this recipe so much is it’s like eating pizza but without all the bread and grains. That’s right, it’s grain-free!

It starts with socca batter infused with garlic and nutritional yeast for flavor (oregano is optional!). Baking powder provides a little rise, but not so much that the edges don’t get browned and a little crisp.
For toppings, we went with red onion, sun-dried tomatoes, vegan macadamia nut cheese, and vegan pesto. But really, whatever you have on hand will work!



We hope you LOVE this pizza! It’s:
Flavorful
Easy to make
Versatile
Colorful
Wholesome
& Uber satisfying
This pizza would make the perfect appetizer on Italian night or even the main event when paired with a green salad like this Loaded Kale Salad!
