To many people, the Mojito represents the perfect rum cocktail. The origins of the drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque, named for Sir Francis Drake.



Appropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing classic cocktail.



The Mojito is traditionally served over ice in a highball glass and often associated with summer. Like your cocktails with literary references? You’re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway.



While the Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, the end result is a delicious, refreshing cocktail that can be enjoyed any time of the year.
