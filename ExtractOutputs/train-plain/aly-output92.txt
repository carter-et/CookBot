30-Minute Quinoa “Fried Rice”


When visiting Mexico recently, we found a little gem in the heart of Puerto Vallarta called Salud Super Food. They had tons of delicious smoothies, perfect oats, and bowls. Their Mediterranean quinoa bowl struck my eye one day, and I’m so glad I gave it a try. The veggies were perfectly seasoned and saucy, and I managed to get my daily serving of greens in one bowl!
But my biggest takeaway? They’d gotten the quinoa perfectly crispy, almost like it’d been cooked and then stir-fried to get that crispy golden crunch.
‘Ding, ding, ding!’ A light bulb went off in my head for “quinoa fried rice” and one of the first things I did when I got home was get in the kitchen and test this recipe.
Good news! It totally worked. Let me show you how easy it is!

This dish requires just 10 ingredients and less than 30 minutes to prepare when your quinoa is prepared ahead of time. If you’re like us, you have leftover quinoa in the fridge most days.
Chopped vegetables get sautéed while you mix up a delicious almond butter-based sauce with coconut aminos for depth of flavor, lime juice, and maple syrup. Dried chilies or chili garlic sauce add a bit of heat, while chopped green onion adds freshness and a pop of color.

Once your veggies are tender, simply add your quinoa and sauce and stir-fry until the quinoa is nice and crispy!

﻿
We hope you LOVE this dish!
Quick + easy
Fresh
Flavorful
Customizable
Nutrient-packed
& Super delicious
This would make the perfect weeknight meal – or one to make ahead of time and enjoy as leftovers. For a little more crunch and staying power, we added some cashews. But you could also add something like Marinated Peanut Tempeh or Crispy Peanut Tofu!

Ingredients
US Customary - Metric 
QUINOA


3
cups
cooked and cooled white quinoa*




SAUCE


4
Tbsp
coconut aminos


1
Tbsp
maple syrup


1
Tbsp
almond butter
(or sub peanut butter)


2
Tbsp
lime juice


2
tsp
chili garlic sauce*
(plus more to taste)


1/4
cup
diced green onion




THE REST


1
Tbsp
sesame oil
(or sub water)


1
cup
finely chopped carrots


3
Tbsp
coconut aminos
(DIVIDED)


1
cup
chopped green onion 
(save green tops for garnish)


1 1/2
cups
chopped broccoli


1/2
cup
roasted cashews
(optional // or sub raw cashews)





Instructions



If you haven’t prepared quinoa yet (*prep/cook time does not include making quinoa), do so first by adding rinsed quinoa to a large saucepan and toasting over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 18 minutes or until water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Transfer cooked quinoa to a glass bowl or storage container and refrigerate (uncovered) to cool. Once completely cooled, cover. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month.


In the meantime, prepare sauce by adding all ingredients to a mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, lime for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, almond butter for nuttiness, or coconut aminos for saltiness and depth of flavor. Set aside.


Heat a large skillet (or wok) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add sesame oil (or water), carrots, and one third of the coconut aminos. Cover and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Carrots take the longest to cook through, so they need a little time on their own.


Next, add chopped green onion, broccoli, and cashews (optional), along with another one third of the coconut aminos. Stir, cover, and cook for 2 minutes or until broccoli appears slightly browned.


Add cooked quinoa and the remaining one third of the coconut aminos. Stir to coat and cook for 1 minute. Then add sauce and stir.


Cook for another 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the quinoa to have a chance to sit at the bottom of your pan and get crispy.


Serve as is, or garnish with additional cashews, lime wedges, and chopped green onion. Best when fresh. Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop until hot.






 

Notes
*Prep time does not include cooking quinoa.*3 cups cooked quinoa is equivalent to approximately 1 1/2 cups (276 g) dry quinoa*In place of the chili garlic sauce, you can also sub 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes or 1-2 hot chilies (per 2 tsp chili garlic sauce).*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated without optional ingredients.

This recipe was great! It took very little time to prep and cook; I just used boil-in-bag tricolor quinoa (for convenience sake) and I added some red bell pepper and I substituted low-sodium soy sauce for coconut aminos. Would probably add even more broccoli if I made it again, and I want to try the sauce with peanut butter instead of almond (just so see how it changes things), but I loved the cashews so much and I thought it had fantastic flavor. Thank you!

I love it! I can’t make anything without making a change. It becomes boring, like when you bake, so I added a red pepper to the mix.
I also subbed sriracha sauce for the Chile sauce and added garlic.  If you like heat, Sprouts sells a great organic red sriracha sauce under their name.
I thank you for posting this recipe. I never would have thought to sub quinoa for rice.  Its delicious and provides lots of protein.

OMG this is the most amazing recipe ever! I made 6 servings. I added 1 red and 1 orange bell bepper, and I used 4 carrots, as well as a whole head of broccoli. I didn’t have coconut aminos so I used what I had left of regular aminos, and the rest naturally brewed Kikkoman.  I used garlic and dried chilli pepper, as per other recommendations. I didn’t have garlic chilli sauce. I used organic chunky peanut butter for the sauce, as I didn’t have any cashews. I definitely recommend adding extra veggies than what the recipe calls for. I am definitely making this again! My friend and I had this as a main, and it’s almost all gone!

This is my favorite alternative fried rice recipe by far! I have a rice allergy and so cannot have even vegan fried rice, and it was one of my favorite meals before my allergy appeared. I used red instead of white quinoa which I soaked in water overnight with apple cider vinegar to improve the digestability of the quinoa (reduce antinutrients), which worked just fine. I also ran out of coconut aminos partway through, so I subbed a smaller quantity of soy sauce. I included raw cashews which really added a nice texture to it.

I love this recipe! I was looking to use some existential quinoa from the fridge and didn’t have everything to make it but it was very adaptable.
Instead of coconut aminos I used liquid aminos and added a tablespoon of coconut oil to the sauce and to the pan to stir fry the quinoa.
I used red onion instead of green, Brussels sprouts instead of broccoli, and garlic and red pepper flakes in place of the chili garlic sauce. Even with all that it is delicious!

This recipe is everything! So simple and seems almost too simple, but it’s amazing. The sauce is incredible. I’ve never had quinoa taste this decadent! (ps – my grocery store didn’t have green onions for some annoying reason, so I sautéed a diced white onion with the carrots and it was great. I’m sure it’s even better the way this recipe is written, though!)

Part of my regular meal rotation! As long as you have the sauce, it’s really easy to customize this recipe to whatever veggies you have in the fridge. Getting the quinoa crispy at the end is a crucial step – don’t skip it! Also very yummy served with any of Dana’s delicious tofu recipes

This was so yummy!! Also, Salud Super Food  in PV was a spot my boyfriend and ate at several times on our trip, ABSOLUTELY recommend that place to anyone traveling there! As for this recipe, I did double the broccoli (should have added even more honesty,) threw in some chickpeas, and added a bit of ginger and garlic powder to the sauce. It was a tad on the sweet side for me, so maybe next time I’ll omit the maple syrup or do half coconut aminos half light soy sauce? Suggestions on that welcome! I think some additional veggies would be nice too.. the cabbage and baby corn mentioned in other comments sounds great. Definitely making this again though, and likely very soon! Tasty and comforting, thanks for this!

Tasty Tasty! Great basic blueprint for fried quinoa – thank you! I used Carrots, Bok Choy, Tofu and TOTALLY switched up the sauce. I had just made a miso-carrot sauce before I looked at this recipe so I decided I would use that instead. It totally worked! My only problem was getting the quinoa crispy. It seemed like it the quinoa wanted squish into the pan instead of fry – so my result was more of a veggie stir-fry with warmed quinoa and sauce. Any tips on how to really get that golden fry on the quinoa (or rice) ?? Maybe I just need to crank the heat. I was also using a cast iron skillet. Cheers!

I wasn’t 100% in love with this the first time I made it, but then I added about double the veggies and 1.5x the sauce and fell in love with it! I think its a great base recipe as written; my personal preference is just for more veggies and sauce because I wanted it to be more of a main than a side. I also added white onion I had leftover and that was great in it too!

Cat Gallagher says

Upon further reflection, I just realized why I thought this tasted diluted the first time I tried it: I didnt have 3 cups quinoa already cooked on hand, and measured 3 cups of UNCOOKED quinoa that I then put into the recipe once it was cooked. Cooked quinoa is bigger than uncooked, so i probably put too much quinoa in and the ratio was off! Now I know for next time :)

I made this recipe last night, my partner does not like quinoa so I am looking at different recipes to find a few he likes. We are in transition to a plant-based lifestyle. He liked this recipe! I am so happy! This recipe was awesome, loved the sauce, the recipe is very easy to put together. I had cauliflower left over so I put that with the broccoli, also, next time I will add some black beans for added nutrients.  But honestly, this recipe, as is, is amazing.
I mesured out the quinoa, I think it is important because I noticed in other recipes that when i put too much quinoa, it is dryer and less tasty because there is not enough sauce.
So thumbs up Minimalist Baker! I love your recipes! :) your recipes are so yummy, makes the transition easier.

I made this and it just didn’t work for me. The sauce had a combination of flavors that I wasn’t really used to. I just thought it tasted…weird? I used soy sauce instead of aminos and had to scale it down a lot because of the saltiness. But with the soy + nut butter + lime + maple, my taste buds didn’t know how to feel about it. The quinoa also didn’t crisp up in the pan, it just got stuck to the bottom. I did enjoy the combo of veggies, cashews, and quinoa together, but I think would’ve preferred it with maybe just some soy sauce on top. Overall, not really what I was expecting/wanting from this recipe, however a lot of it was probably just preference.

Hi, I made this today – it was delicious! I used tamari instead of coconut aminos but otherwise made this as per the recipe. I washed the quinoa and toasted it for 2 minutes as per the instructions. While it was tasty, I couldn’t seem to get the crunchiness, even after leaving the quinoa for a couple of minutes at the bottom of the pan to get crispy at the end. Any tips on how I can get the quinoa to become crispy/crunchy? Should I be toasting them for longer at the start? Thank you!

I used soy sauce instead of coconut aminos, and reduced it by 2 1/2 tablespoons. I still found the end product too salty to be eaten along so I would probably use 2 tablespoons less next time! However, it is so flavorful and easy. It is now perfectly salty to be use as a lettuce-cup or taco filling. Definitely going to make it again!

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
June 28, 2018 at 3:02 am 

Lovely, thanks for sharing! Coconut aminos is less pungent in flavor and saltiness in my opinion, so if using soy or tamari starting small and working your way up to taste can be helpful.

Can’t wait to try this but what chili garlic sauce did you use? Did you make your own?

This is a great recipe that I can see us using as a staple especially during the CSA months when we need to throw a low of veggies together! I subbed the broccoli with snow peas and added kohlrabi and some garlic scapes because that’s what we had, as well as tamari for the coconut aminos. Scaled back on the spice so the 2.5 year old would eat it. I could see us adding tofu as well in the future. Delish!!

I’ve honestly never been a huge fan of rice…but I love quinoa! Can’t wait to try this; I know I will love the sauce too!

I did this yesterday!
I did some twerking, though, partially because I’m kinda unable to follow directions and also because I don’t like the charred taste that sometimes brocoli get when they get tossed into the wok. So, I steamed the carrots and brocoli before, and used soy sauce instead of coconut aminos.
It worked very well, thank you for the inspiration :)

Hi Dana, this recipe looks delicious I’m definitely gonna give it a try. I have one doubt (always have this doubt when cooking quinoa or millet): do you wash the quinoa before you toast it? I read that you have to wash it well, but then I found that if you toast it while wet, it will not toast well. What do you suggest? Thanks :)

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says

So, I use sprouted quinoa that doesn’t need to be rinsed. If using unsprouted, yes it’s always a good idea to rinse. Even if wet, you can still toast the quinoa. I’ll add that to the instructions – thanks!

I made this for my first dinner after a 28 day all raw fruit and veggie cleanse.  It was unbelievable.  I substituted, summer squash & zucchini cut into quarters…(I didn’t have carrots) and added a can of baby corn… the colors were all green and Yellow, but man the flavor is out of this WORLD!!! The sauce was the big kicker!!!!  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.  5 stars.

I made this twice yesterday! The first batch was eaten immediately by us 4, which left nothing for the 5th family member who would be home soon. I had extra quinoia so I made a double batch the second time. I ran out of green onions after using them in the sauce, so I sauted a red onion with the carrots instead, still yummy. I did add an extra tablespoon of peanutbutter to the sauce. I thought the dish was very homey, felt like eating Sunday dinner’s growing up… just  felt good in your mouth. I found my coco aminos at Costco, and my girlfriend got hers at Trader Joe’s. Its a little sweeter than soy sauce with simpler ingredients, and no wheat. Also, chili garlic sauce is the bomb!

Super delicious! I threw some red cabbage in there, too. And some extra spice, because I like things spicy. I think in the future I might chop up a clove of garlic as well, as I think it could add a little flavor to it. But overall, we loved it! Quick and filling dinner.

Upping this protein content, would you advise something like chickpeas or beans?

That looks so good. I am going to try it this week, but I’ll substitute asparagus for the broccoli as my wee boy doesn’t like broccoli. My mouth was actually watering as I scrolled down the page. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh! I need to make this asap!!! But I don’t have any coconut aminos, can I sub tamari? How much should I use then?

Dana @ Minimalist Baker says 
June 21, 2018 at 1:29 pm 

Totally! Tamari! You can scale back a little at first since tamari can be more potent than coconut aminos. And build up to taste. Let us know how it goes!
