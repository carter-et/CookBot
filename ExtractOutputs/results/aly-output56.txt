1/4 cup rolled oats (ensure gluten-free friendly as needed)
1/4 cup gluten-free flour (or sub other flour, such as almond or unbleached all-purpose)
1/4 tsp sea salt (plus more for topping)
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup brown sugar (or try subbing coconut sugar, but we only tested with brown)
1/2 cup creamy salted peanut butter (we like Wild Friends â€” ingredients should only be peanuts and salt)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg (organic, pasture-raised when possible)
3 Tbsp dark chocolate chips (dairy-free), chopped (plus more for topping)
