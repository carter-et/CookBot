1 whole cinnamon stick
6-8 green cardamom pods
1 tsp whole black peppercorns
3-4 whole cloves
2 Â½ cups water
2 Tbsp grated ginger (for less intense ginger flavor, slice instead of grating)
3 Tbsp loose leaf black tea (or ~3-4 black tea bags // use decaf as needed)
2 cups dairy-free milk (we favor oat milk, coconut milk, and cashew milk // use thicker, richer dairy-free milks like canned coconut milk or our Oatly recipe for creamier chai!)
Sweetener such as stevia, organic cane sugar, or maple syrup to taste
