3/4 cup short-grain brown or white rice, rinsed (soaking for 12-24 hours to speed cooking is optional*)
1 ½ cups water (if rice was soaked, reduce water by about 1/4 cup (60 ml) as recipe is written)
1 pinch sea salt
2-3 Tbsp sesame oil, DIVIDED (toasted for more flavor, untoasted works, too*)
3 cups packed mixed vegetables (such as finely shredded carrot, thinly sliced zucchini, or spinach)
1 heaping cup bean sprouts (if you can’t find, sub more mixed vegetables)
2 stalks green onion, sliced on an angle
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp coconut aminos, DIVIDED (or sub tamari to taste, or sea salt)
2 large eggs* (we recommend organic, pasture-raised, and as ethically sourced as possible, such as Vital Farms)
2-4 Tbsp Korean Gochujang Sauce (or sub store-bought — look for vegan or gluten-free as needed, such as Wholly Gochujang)
Kimchi (optional)
Toasted or raw sesame seeds (optional)
