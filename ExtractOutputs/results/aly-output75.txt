1 ½ pounds flaky white fish, skin removed (we used Pacific cod // we think shrimp or even chicken could work here as well — just make sure it's fresh!)
2 Tbsp avocado or olive oil
3/4 tsp sea salt (or enough to season both sides well)
1/4 tsp black pepper (a light dusting over both sides)
1 cup fresh chopped herbs (we used fresh thyme, basil, oregano, and rosemary — go for whatever you have on hand)
2 Tbsp lime juice
1 Tbsp avocado or olive oil
1/2 medium white, yellow, or red onion
2 medium tomatoes, stems + core removed, sliced into thin wedges
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 medium bell peppers, seeds + stems removed, thinly sliced lengthwise (we used green, yellow, orange, and red)
1/2 tsp sea salt (plus more to taste)
1 pinch black pepper
Lime wedges
Cilantro
Green Rice or Green Cauliflower Rice
