2 Tbsp coconut or avocado oil (DIVIDED // if avoiding oil, sub water)
3 heaping cups thinly sliced shiitake or cremini mushrooms
1 Tbsp vegan worcestershire or coconut aminos (ensure vegan and gluten-free friendly)

2 cups cooked brown or green lentils (rinsed and well drained)
1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper (plus more to taste)
4 Tbsp tomato paste
2 Tbsp vegan worcestershire or coconut aminos (ensure vegan and gluten-free friendly as needed)
