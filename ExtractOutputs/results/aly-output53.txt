1 small-medium head cauliflower (cut into even, bite-size florets)
1 healthy pinch each sea salt and black pepper
2 large eggs, beaten (organic pasture-raised when possible // see notes for vegan option)
1 ½ cups raw cashews (or sub other nut, such as almonds or almond flour, though we haven’t tested these ourselves)
1 ¼ tsp sea salt (plus more to season cauliflower before coating)
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (increase for more spice)
3/4 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp smoked paprika
2 Tbsp arrowroot starch, cornstarch, or potato starch (or try subbing brown or white rice flour, though we haven’t tried these ourselves)
1 spritz avocado oil (optional // from a spray bottle // otherwise omit)
2 Tbsp honey (if vegan, sub maple syrup)
3 Tbsp hot sauce or buffalo sauce (we like Yellow Bird Habanero for this recipe)
1 pinch red pepper flake (optional)
